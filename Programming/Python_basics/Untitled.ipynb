    "#### if __name__ == '__main__' in a few Python modules. __name__ is usually the variable holding the name of the module itself (so if you had a module called music.py, __name__ would hold music.) However, if you’re running the module directly through thepython command or some other means, __name__ will be __main__ instead. So when you see that `if statement`, it means that that block of code will only run if this module is being `run directly` (i.e. not imported.)"
