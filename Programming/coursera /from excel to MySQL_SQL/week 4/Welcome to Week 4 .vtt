00:00:04.664 --> 00:00:09.630
Welcome to the final week of
Managing Big Data with MySQL and Teradata.

2
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.870
You have done a terrific job working
through all the exercises that teach you

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.600
how to write SQL queries.

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.480
This week we are going to learn a couple
of additional tools that will make

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.170
it easier for you to write queries that
extract the specific data you want.

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.390
The first thing you are going to
learn is how to write subqueries.

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.880
Subqueries, also known as inner queries,
or nested queries, are a mechanism for

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.380
breaking up the operations in
an overall query into separate steps.

9
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.430
By doing this, subqueries help solve a lot
of problems we encounter with aggregation

10
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.310
functions and joins, and
sometimes provide us with more

11
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.890
elegant ways to represent
the logic behind our queries.

12
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.160
You'll see that the first trick to
subqueries is making sure you format

13
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.060
them so that it's easy to see which parts
of the query will be executed together.

14
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.750
The second trick is to write and interpret
the subquery starting with the innermost

15
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.430
query first, working your way out
step by step to the outermost query.

16
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.440
You will already know how
this works after completing

17
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.590
the first exercise of this week.

18
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.510
After that,
we will learn about a couple other logical

19
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.650
functions that you might want to use
in your analysis of business data.

20
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.040
Then in the last phase of
this week's assignments,

21
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.200
we're going to talk about how to translate
your analysis objectives into questions

22
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.040
that can be addressed through queries.

23
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.590
The first thing you need to do in order to
accomplish these objectives is figure out

24
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.450
the right questions to ask, and

25
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.310
come up with a plan about how you're going
to answer those questions efficiently.

26
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.171
Here's Elliot Cohen again,
producer at Dognition,

27
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:32.352
giving us his opinion about how important
this part of the analysis process is.

28
00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:36.737
>> The most important thing that we found
is that you have to go into every test

29
00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:38.020
with a question.

30
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.160
You need to have a hypothesis, and

31
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.950
you need to know exactly what
you're doing to test that.

32
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.210
Because if you're just going in and
looking,

33
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.010
either you're going to find things
that don't matter, which is useless.

34
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.790
Or you're not going to find
anything which is equally useless.

35
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.120
So find a testable
hypothesis before you go in,

36
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.690
is the only really
important thing I'd say.

37
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.983
>> We are going to talk about resources
you can use to design an analysis plan

38
00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.680
based on specific hypotheses and
questions.

39
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.390
Then we're going to use
the analysis plan we've created for

40
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.040
our Dognition project to practice turning
business questions into SQL queries.

41
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.200
Many of the questions we will ask about
Dognition users would be similar to

42
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.560
the questions business analysts
at Box ask about their users.

43
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.370
Here's Ryan Lueke again.

44
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.710
>> Yes,
our business analysts use SQL to query

45
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.320
data that we have about how users use Box.

46
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.070
So both usage patterns, like,
how active are our users?

47
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.300
How many active 30 day users do we have or
7 day?

48
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.700
Or how many pieces of content
do they upload per week?

49
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.580
Or are they active mostly on weekdays or
weekends?

50
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.700
Based on their locale,
what sort of collaboration do they do?

51
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.240
How about the difference between how
users in our free tier operate versus

52
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.610
how users in our business or
enterprise class tiers operate?

53
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.830
>> You will address questions that
are very similar to these in the exercises

54
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.749
you will complete this week.

55
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.490
I think one of the hardest parts about
learning SQL is figuring out how to

56
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.150
translate the words you would
use to describe the analytical

57
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.850
results you know you want to achieve, into
actual SQL query language on a screen.

58
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.840
The best way to do that is
through practice writing

59
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.180
queries that are specifically
designed to help you analyze and

60
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.470
interpret the data you
have in front of you.

61
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.590
So you will start that practice using
queries related to our Dognition analysis

62
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.999
plan, which you will go
through step by step.

63
00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.360
Then you will answer many similar
queries using the Dillard's data set.

64
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.358
In essence, we're going to practice,
practice, practice, and

65
00:03:28.358 --> 00:03:29.524
then practice some more.

66
00:03:29.524 --> 00:03:32.651
By the end, you will feel confident
claiming that you know how to write SQL

67
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:34.880
queries to create business value.

68
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.160
Let's jump in and start, shall we?
