1
00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:07.707
Congratulations on working
through all those SQL lessons.

2
00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:10.076
You should really be proud of yourself.

3
00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:13.160
You've now learned everything you need to
know to retrieve the data that will allow

4
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.068
you to start figuring out how to increase
Dognition's test completion rate,

5
00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:19.350
which is the business problem Dognition
would like us to help them solve.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.516
You're ready to start our analysis, right?

7
00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:23.426
Mm, not quite yet.

8
00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:25.445
I love that you are excited to jump in.

9
00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:29.184
And believe me, I am really excited
to analyze the Dognition dataset too.

10
00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:31.239
But here's what you need to think about.

11
00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.744
Your job as a business analyst isn't
just to do something exciting.

12
00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:38.253
It's to do something that will clarify
exactly what a business should do to solve

13
00:00:38.253 --> 00:00:39.250
a problem.

14
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.344
In other words, to create value.

15
00:00:41.344 --> 00:00:44.958
And even more, it's to do this as
quickly and efficiently as possible, and

16
00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:48.572
preferably in a fashion that allows you
to update the people invested in your

17
00:00:48.572 --> 00:00:51.128
project, or your stake holders,
on your progress.

18
00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:54.211
I am going to give you a piece of advice
from years of data analysis which I talk

19
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:55.848
about a lot in the Data Visualization and

20
00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:58.370
Communication with Tableau
course in this specialization.

21
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.850
Do not enter a data analysis project,
don't even start looking at the data,

22
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.960
without a structured analysis plan.

23
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.195
And the bigger the data,
the more structured the plan should be.

24
00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:12.620
Remember I mentioned in an earlier in the
video that a data analysis project needs

25
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.330
to provide insight into business processes
that a business has the ability and

26
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.620
willingness to improve in
order to create new value.

27
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.070
Data analysts need to always be
thinking about the following questions.

28
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.420
What questions will provide
actionable insight?

29
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.374
Will the answers to my questions matter?

30
00:01:27.374 --> 00:01:29.775
Are the answers to my questions correct?

31
00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:32.328
We talked about the last question
when we were learning how to write

32
00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:33.560
aggregate queries.

33
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.630
Now it's time to talk about
the first two questions.

34
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.030
You may have heard the term
analysis paralysis before.

35
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.540
It's a real thing.

36
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.320
It's what happens when you are so
overwhelmed by all the ways you can

37
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.060
analyze a dataset that you
end up doing nothing at all.

38
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.390
Even more dangerous, though,
is what I call analysis free-for-all.

39
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.506
This is when you just start analyzing
whatever seems fun or interesting.

40
00:01:53.506 --> 00:01:56.435
When you do that, you end up with
all kinds of interesting but

41
00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:59.025
disconnected results that you
don't know how to make sense of,

42
00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:03.055
even if you've been implementing complex
beautiful graphs and analyses for months.

43
00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:05.933
When you have to present what you
found to your stakeholders using this

44
00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:09.055
analysis strategy, you may be able to
piece together some type of desperate

45
00:02:09.055 --> 00:02:11.372
data story from the different
analyses you've tried.

46
00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:14.108
But the story usually has little to do
with the original business problem that

47
00:02:14.108 --> 00:02:14.875
needed to be solved.

48
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.600
The dangers of analysis paralysis and
analysis free-for-all start

49
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.640
at the very beginning, when you want to
begin playing around with the data so

50
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.540
that you can get a feel for
what they tell you.

51
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.590
Although playing around is useful and
actually necessary, you

52
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.730
can also end up biasing your strategy in
ways that may be irrelevant to your goals.

53
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.773
So it is very important that you have
a plan about exactly what analyses you

54
00:02:34.773 --> 00:02:38.620
are going to implement to address the
business problems it's your job to solve

55
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.080
before you start running analysis.

56
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.990
The plan should be inspired by
these two guiding questions.

57
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.430
We don't have time to go over exactly how
to make analysis plans in this course, but

58
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.990
I described one of my favorite
methods in the Data Visualization and

59
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.380
Communication with Tableau course
earlier in this specialization.

60
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.240
I call that method structured
pyramid analysis plans, or SPAPs.

61
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.510
Since we won't be able to
make one together right now,

62
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.500
I provided an outline for
you in the course materials.

63
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.760
In essence, what you will see is
a specific, measurable, attainable,

64
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.511
relevant and time-bound goal for
the project, otherwise known as S.M.A.R.T.

65
00:03:12.511 --> 00:03:14.340
Goal, at the top of the pyramid.

66
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.800
The variables you will use to assess the
goal will be written underneath the goal.

67
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.580
And underneath those variables you will
see ever-widening layers of categories and

68
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.690
subcategories of issues that will be
important to analyze in order to achieve

69
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.180
your S.M.A.R.T. Goal.

70
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.930
Under normal circumstances these
categories would be derived from

71
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.690
conversations with your stakeholders and

72
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.760
your analysis team during a process called
elicitation, to make sure the categories

73
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.410
are relevant to the solutions your
company is willing and able to implement.

74
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.790
One of the features of the SPAP
framework is that you are supposed

75
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.440
write down the exact variable or
column name you need

76
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.220
to address a question about a certain
category or subcategory of factors.

77
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.490
The utility of the steps should be much
more clear, now that you are actually

78
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.230
the one who will be writing the SQL
queries to retrieve the data for analysis.

79
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.480
The more specific you can be about
what variables you need to analyze,

80
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.400
the more able you will be to
determine whether it's actually

81
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.280
possible to analyze those variables given
the tables you have in your database.

82
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.670
Being clear about what variables you
need and how you will combine them

83
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.930
will also make it much easier and more
efficient for you to proceed through and

84
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.440
write the appropriate SQL queries for
each category of questions.

85
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.992
Another thing we learned about
in Data Visualization and

86
00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:22.343
Communication with Tableau is that data
analysis only plays a role in one or

87
00:04:22.343 --> 00:04:24.947
two parts of the life cycle of
a data analysis project, and

88
00:04:24.947 --> 00:04:28.480
SQL queries play an even more
constrained role than that.

89
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.325
SQL queries are solely in this
part of the project life cycle,

90
00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:34.128
where we're retrieving the data and
making computations.

91
00:04:34.128 --> 00:04:38.417
Of course, the SQL queries are absolutely
critical for the project to be successful,

92
00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:42.381
which is why data analysts who know how
to use SQL queries are so highly coveted.

93
00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:45.844
But it's important to keep in mind that
queries are just one part of your job.

94
00:04:45.844 --> 00:04:48.894
You need to make sure that you
are implementing queries that address

95
00:04:48.894 --> 00:04:52.533
the right questions in the right way to
lead you towards a strong hypothesis about

96
00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:55.570
what business changes could
achieve your S.M.A.R.T. Goal.

97
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.773
With that in mind, I'm going to do
my best in the next few lessons,

98
00:04:58.773 --> 00:05:01.922
taking into consideration that
our primary goal is to learn SQL,

99
00:05:01.922 --> 00:05:05.873
to make those SQL queries we practiced
address real analysis questions that could

100
00:05:05.873 --> 00:05:08.646
help us arrive at some insights
to present to Dognition.

101
00:05:08.646 --> 00:05:11.362
The analysis questions I address
will be based on the SPAP I

102
00:05:11.362 --> 00:05:13.033
included in the course materials.

103
00:05:13.033 --> 00:05:15.471
When you start doing SQL
queries in your own business,

104
00:05:15.471 --> 00:05:18.655
I highly recommend that you make
a similar analysis plan for yourself.

105
00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:20.311
If you need help learning how to do that,

106
00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:23.335
please refer to the materials posted
in week one of Data Visualization and

107
00:05:23.335 --> 00:05:26.540
Communication with Tableau
in this specialization.

108
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.410
Now that we know about analysis plans,

109
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.510
let's go help Dognition solve
their business problem.
