1
00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:06.061
At this point in the course, hopefully,

2
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:09.979
we're starting to feel pretty comfortable
with SQL Syntax, and have started to get

3
00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:13.310
a good sense of some of those SQL
queries you will be using as an analyst.

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.373
Before we continue though, I wanted to
take a moment to give you some perspective

5
00:00:17.373 --> 00:00:20.317
about where SQL queries fall
in your job as a data analyst.

6
00:00:20.317 --> 00:00:23.842
We designed the specialization and
analytic techniques for business, to help

7
00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:27.250
prepare you to be the type of business
analyst who creates value out of data.

8
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.940
In this fourth course
of the specialization,

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.090
we are not just focusing on
the details about how to write SQL

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.660
queries because relational
databases are interesting,

11
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.600
we are focusing on the details about how
to write SQL queries because writing

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.710
SQL queries is one of the skills that
will help you create business value.

13
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.000
Learning the technical rules for how
to write SQL queries is very important.

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.710
That's why we have this course after all.

15
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.310
And it's good to focus on
the rules while you are learning.

16
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.220
But try to remember
the broader perspective as we

17
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.330
go through the details of these rule.

18
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.200
Even if you write the perfect SQL query,

19
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.500
the output of the query won't create
business value, unless the questions you

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.170
ask are meaningful and your
interpretation of the results are correct.

21
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.910
Thinking about this end goal might
give you the motivation you need

22
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.470
to pay attention to the details
which determine whether your queries

23
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.710
really give you the results you want.

24
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.880
Another way to think about the broader
perspective, is that for a data analysis

25
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.700
project to provide tangible value for a
company, it needs to provide insight into

26
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.490
business processes that a business has
the ability and willingness to improve.

27
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.560
A data analyst working on such
a project needs to always be thinking

28
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.760
about the following questions.

29
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.250
What questions will provide
actionable insight?

30
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.450
Will the answers to my questions matter?

31
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.170
Are the answers to my questions correct?

32
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.920
We'll come back to the first two of these
questions in the last week of this course.

33
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.780
But we can already start thinking
about the last question now,

34
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.009
as we are starting to write queries.

35
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.020
Real life data sets are messy and
complicated.

36
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.230
If you aren't paying attention,
you could miss the mess and

37
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.290
arrive at incorrect conclusions.

38
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.550
You just saw an example in our last
MySQL exercise about what messy

39
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.680
data looked like.

40
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.466
If you hadn't explored the raw time stamps
of the exam answers table in the Dognition

41
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:02.660
dataset you might have included some
very incorrect data in your reaction

42
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.980
time summaries.

43
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.980
So how do you make sure you catch these
mistakes in your data before you make

44
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.690
business recommendations?

45
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.210
The answer is that you start,

46
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.830
now, building habits that will enable you
to catch even the smallest hints that

47
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.050
something might be wrong
with your analysis.

48
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.769
Here's Elena Grewal, data science manager
from the well-known Airbnb sharing her

49
00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.680
perspective about these habits.

50
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.558
>> And so I think being kind of single
mindedly paranoid about your data

51
00:02:27.558 --> 00:02:32.960
quality is actually one of the biggest
ways that you can prevent mistakes.

52
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.882
I kind of think about it as
developing a data intuition,

53
00:02:35.882 --> 00:02:40.765
there's this kind of sense that you
have that something's not quite right.

54
00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:44.295
And that comes with experience, for
sure, where you get really familiar with

55
00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:48.375
the data that you're looking at, and
you can say, wait, I know that on average

56
00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:52.785
the percentage is this, why is it
different in my table, something is wrong.

57
00:02:52.785 --> 00:02:55.629
And that's definitely very important for
helping to remand mistakes.

58
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.140
>> In the Data Visualization and

59
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.470
Communication with Tableau course, I gave
you ten tips for becoming a data analyst.

60
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.030
Two of those tips involve building habits
that will help you catch mistakes.

61
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.470
My first tip was to get in the habit
of being skeptical about your data, or

62
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.950
as I said train your skepticism muscles.

63
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.780
Here is my description.

64
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.290
I'm telling you this from experience.

65
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.150
Whenever you see a really dramatic or
surprising effect in your data

66
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.180
that nobody in your team or
company expected, nine times out of ten or

67
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.130
maybe even 99 times out of 100, it's
due to a bookkeeping or coding mistake.

68
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.640
There's probably a bug in your code, a
misaligned column in your spreadsheet, or

69
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.800
incorrect labels somewhere
in your data set.

70
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.720
Similarly, whenever somebody tells you
something with extreme confidence,

71
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.390
temper your expectations.

72
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.350
It's probably more complicated and
messy than they are making it out to be.

73
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.310
I also told you to seek details.

74
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.150
Don't take your data at face value.

75
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.650
Be passionate about figuring out
what your data really looked like.

76
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.740
The way to put Elena's and my advice into
practice now, is to challenge yourself to

77
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.780
think of different ways to
make sure your results and

78
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.060
interpretations are correct as
you practice writing queries.

79
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.240
Always look at subsets in the data and
query outputs with your eyes,

80
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.070
before you start strongly interpreting
calculations and aggregate functions.

81
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.800
And as soon as you feel comfortably
enough with queries syntax, start looking

82
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.080
at every aspect of the Dognition data you
can to get a feel for what they look like.

83
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.300
Examine them with an eye for

84
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.760
how the data could be used to answer
Dognition's business questions.

85
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.770
Overall, you are trying to cultivate
an insatiable desire to find the right

86
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.250
answers to your business problem.

87
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.192
If you are motivated by getting
the correct answers, you will be more

88
00:04:30.192 --> 00:04:33.170
likely to be motivated to catch
mistakes in your queries along the way,

89
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.510
that could impact your
analysis conclusions.

90
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.770
So whenever you are getting
frustrated with SQL queries, or

91
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.050
disheartened by the messiness of
the data you are working with,

92
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.180
just remember the broader perspective.

93
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.890
You are creating brand new value for
your business,

94
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.410
that it didn't even know existed.

95
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.010
That's really exciting.

96
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.690
And it's also worth getting right.

97
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.330
So pay attention to details, and be ready
to conquer any mistakes in the data or

98
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.410
your queries that come your way.
