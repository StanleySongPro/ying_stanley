1
00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:06.000
Well done.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.880
You've now learned the tools you need to
run segmentation analyses that incorporate

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.090
data from multiple tables at once.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.310
At this point you don't need help from
anybody else to retrieve the data you need

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.460
from a database.

6
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.550
No more waiting 48 hours, to a week, for

7
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.300
somebody else in the company
to provide data for you.

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.450
Next week you will learn a couple more
tools that will help you refine your

9
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.900
analyses even further.

10
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.000
To motivate you, here's a reward
in the form of a little story,

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.620
for all the hard work
you've done this week.

12
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.690
A very polite sequel
query walks into a bar.

13
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.688
In one corner of the bar are two tables.

14
00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:41.181
The very polite sequel query walks up to
the tables and asks, mind if I join you?
