00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.820
Hi, there.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.780
I hope you really enjoyed
the Jupyter MySQL exercises, and

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.820
are starting to feel very comfortable with
the SQL syntax we are learning this week.

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.780
In this video I'm going to show you
how to use the interface we are going

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.050
to use in this course to interact and

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.210
analyze our Dillards dataset,
which is kept in a Teradata database.

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.810
The overall interface we're going to
use is called, Teradata Viewpoint.

8
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.740
The Teradata Viewpoint actually has many
capabilities that we aren't going to

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.370
use in this course at all.

10
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.150
The part we are going to use
is called SQL Scratchpad.

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.260
That's the part that allows us to
write and execute SQL queries.

12
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.564
So to learn how to use SQL Scratchpad
within Teradata Viewpoint,

13
00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:43.508
I want you to follow the instructions
with the materials or

14
00:00:43.508 --> 00:00:46.528
that are described in the materials
in the course website.

15
00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:51.270
About how to get your own username and
password to the Teradata interface.

16
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.620
Once you have that username and
password emailed to you,

17
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.940
I want you to go to the website that's
described in the course materials that

18
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.030
points you to the Teradata interface.

19
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.690
Once you go to the website,
it should look something like this.

20
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.840
So I want you to enter the password
that was emailed to you.

21
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.780
Or enter the username and
password and log in.

22
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.860
Then you're going to see
this general Interface.

23
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.840
Go to, Select System > UATD.

24
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.620
It's going to ask you to type in
your username and password again, so

25
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.660
go ahead and type in the same username and
password you just did in the past screen.

26
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.450
All of the rest of this can be kept as
default, so Authentication Mechanism

27
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.880
should be default, Character Set,
UTF8, go ahead and press Connect.

28
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.008
Once it's connected you'll see over
here in the Object Browser UATD.

29
00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:56.103
I want you to press on the plus button, so

30
00:01:56.103 --> 00:02:00.246
that it shows you all the different things
that are held within this interface.

31
00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:04.864
And I want you to put

32
00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:09.488
in UA_Dillards.

33
00:02:09.488 --> 00:02:11.080
And you'll see that it comes up.

34
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.954
It filters all the results, and
it comes up with these two options.

35
00:02:13.954 --> 00:02:18.250
The one we are going to
use is the UA_DILLARDS.

36
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.680
So if you press the plus button here,

37
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.320
it will show you all the different
parts within this database.

38
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.680
And if you expand the tables part,

39
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.650
it will show you all the different
tables in this database.

40
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.610
So over here on the left is where we
can actually write our queries and

41
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.710
see our results.

42
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.810
This part up here is where we
can write our queries, and

43
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.160
this part down here is where
the results will appear.

44
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.590
So the very first thing you should do,
before you start doing anything else,

45
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.780
is you should make the UA_DILLARDS
your default database.

46
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.336
Do that, you write in Database ua_dilards,
and then press Run.

47
00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.653
And you'll see that it's
loading its results, and

48
00:03:00.653 --> 00:03:04.910
it'll say zero rows processed when it's
finished making it the default database.

49
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.240
Then you're ready to run some queries.

50
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.756
So let's for example, try something like.

51
00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:25.810
This should give us the top
100 rows from department info.

52
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.050
So go ahead and press Run.

53
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.790
And you'll see all the results down here.

54
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.844
And like the Jupyter interface,
the Teradata interface will also

55
00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:43.818
limit the number of rows you're going to
see in each one of these panes.

56
00:03:43.818 --> 00:03:48.718
But it will tell you what the total
amount of output would be

57
00:03:48.718 --> 00:03:51.528
if it didn't limit the display.

58
00:03:51.528 --> 00:03:54.459
Now if I was to write another query here,

59
00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.100
it would just overwrite
the results down here.

60
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.180
But you can pin this results to look
at them later by pressing this button.

61
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.398
So if you press the pin results,
it now labels this pinned one.

62
00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:16.258
I can put in a different query And run it.

63
00:04:24.528 --> 00:04:30.146
And you see that in Query 2, which is
what I just ran, these are the results.

64
00:04:30.146 --> 00:04:34.762
But my results from before,
from my original query,

65
00:04:34.762 --> 00:04:40.260
SELECT TOP 100 * FROM deptinfo,
are still retained.

66
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.640
I can also pin my Query 2 results by again
pressing the pin result button here.

67
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.110
I can unpin them so

68
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.830
I don't save them anymore simply
by clicking the pin button again.

69
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.880
So you can see, if I hover over it,
it says, Unpin results.

70
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.270
So just click on that.

71
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.820
And now when I write another query,
the first pin results will disappear.

72
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.870
So, if I do something like this,

73
00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:16.528
You'll see that the Pinned 1 results
are from the query I just ran.

74
00:05:16.528 --> 00:05:21.458
So it says, top 20 skew,
but the results from

75
00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:26.060
the query I ran above,
are here in Query 2.

76
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.368
So far I showed you what would happen
if we randomly one query at a time.

77
00:05:30.368 --> 00:05:34.270
But the scratchpad does give us the option
of running multiple queries at a time.

78
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.150
So if we unpin this result and

79
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.210
we put in two queries here, remember
that the important thing will be that in

80
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.230
order to run multiple queries, you have to
have a semicolon at the end of each query.

81
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.340
Otherwise, the database won't know
that they're two separate queries.

82
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.870
So in order to run both queries at the
same time, come over to the Run options.

83
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.750
Go to the dropdown and
you'll see it says, Run Selected Queries.

84
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.006
Select both queries And

85
00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:14.418
you'll see that there's one tab for
Query 1, and

86
00:06:14.418 --> 00:06:18.938
one tab for Query 2, and
it ran them sequentially.

87
00:06:18.938 --> 00:06:22.340
You could also run just
one of them at a time.

88
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.894
So if I wanted to run just the bottom one,
I could select it and

89
00:06:25.894 --> 00:06:29.688
then say Run Selected Query and
it would only run the bottom one.

90
00:06:34.118 --> 00:06:37.189
Another thing you can do from
this dropdown that's very

91
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:39.028
useful is you can save the query.

92
00:06:39.028 --> 00:06:43.932
So you could either save all
the queries or save the selected query,

93
00:06:43.932 --> 00:06:47.460
and this will let you save it permanently.

94
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.000
So the pin capability I was showing you
before only works for a given session.

95
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.850
Once you log out all the results in your
pinned results tab won't be there anymore.

96
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.130
But when you save queries they will
be there when you sign in to your

97
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.180
account later.

98
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.830
So this is if you want to save
your queries permanently.

99
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.710
So if you press Save Selected Query,
you can name it.

100
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:25.270
And then you would be able to find it
later By going to the Load button.

101
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.010
We see, if you hover over the Load button,

102
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.270
that you can either get your saved
queries or look at you queries history.

103
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:36.108
Go ahead and press Load, you can see
this is the one query that I saved.

104
00:07:36.108 --> 00:07:41.582
So if I press Load,
it will bring it up again.

105
00:07:41.582 --> 00:07:46.076
It just appended it to the queries I had,
so let me erase them and do that again.

106
00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:53.960
And that was the query I ran before,
and I could now run it again.

107
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.209
But you could also go
to the History tab and

108
00:07:56.209 --> 00:08:00.526
this would show you all the different
queries you've run during this session.

109
00:08:00.526 --> 00:08:05.419
And you could click on any one of them And

110
00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:08.840
load it, and rerun it again as well.

111
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.590
So you can see that overall the SQL
scratchpad interface is very simple and

112
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.958
very straightforward.

113
00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:20.386
The main things you need to know are that
the table information is written

114
00:08:20.386 --> 00:08:21.860
over here.

115
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.540
This is where you write your queries.

116
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.450
This is where the output comes.

117
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.420
I didn't like that result.

118
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.300
That one should have
had sku instead of sky.

119
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.860
You can save your queries over here.

120
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.180
Or run only selected ones.

121
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.460
And you can load your queries here.

122
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.910
The only other thing you need
to know is this button up here.

123
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:43.756
This is very useful.

124
00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.430
This is where the help is.

125
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:51.442
If you press on this little
icon that has a question mark,

126
00:08:51.442 --> 00:08:58.846
you'll see a really comprehensive
collection of help information.

127
00:08:58.846 --> 00:09:02.040
In particular, what I think you should
focus on is the Teradata Viewpoint.

128
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.440
So if you click on that plus button,
it will expand all the options.

129
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.220
And the part that you should
care about the SQL Scratchpad.

130
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:14.100
So if you expand that, and
click on SQL Scratchpad,

131
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.500
you'll see all of these different options
that will tell you the details about how

132
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.220
to use the query box, the results,
the history tab, or the save tab.

133
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.500
So feel free to explore these
if you have any questions.

134
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.170
I'm sure that they will be very helpful.

135
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.150
And with that, you are ready to
analyze the Dillards data set

136
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.337
using the Teradata Viewpoint and
SQL Scratchpad interface.

137
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.430
You might have noticed that I used
a keyword in some of the queries I just

138
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.330
wrote that you haven't seen yet.

139
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.360
That keyword is top.

140
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.150
Teradata uses top instead of limit
to limit the output if it's queries.

141
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.300
It's one of the few differences between
the MySQL and Teradata syntaxes.

142
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.520
Make sure you look at the course website
for materials that describe some

143
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.810
other differences between the syntax
that Teradata and MySQL uses.

144
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.766
Those same materials will also help
prepare you for the quiz this week.

145
00:10:01.766 --> 00:10:05.471
This quiz is going to be based on
queries you write by yourself to analyze

146
00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:08.760
the Dillards data set using
the Teradata interface.

147
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.880
I'm sure you're going to do a great job.

148
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.170
Have fun, good luck,
and I'll see you soon.
