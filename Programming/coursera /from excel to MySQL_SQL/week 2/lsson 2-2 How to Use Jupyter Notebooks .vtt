00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.103
Hi, guys, in the last video,

2
00:00:06.103 --> 00:00:09.020
you got an introduction about
how to write SQL queries.

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.441
In the next two videos,
I'm going to give you a tour of Jupyter.

4
00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:16.057
Jupyter is the front end interface
we'll use in this course to interact

5
00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:19.320
with our Dognition dataset,
which is kept in a MySQL database.

6
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.560
I told you that there are many different
types of frontend interfaces you might

7
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.090
encounter in your career.

8
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.130
Despite all these options,
Jupiter is really unique.

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.340
It was written explicitly for

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.400
collaboration, which also happens to
make it very useful for education.

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.333
What Jupyter does, is it allows me a way
to write in text, an explanation for

12
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:43.050
every query you try and help you
understand the logic behind each query.

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.732
And then you can read that text at your
own pace and try out different parts of

14
00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:50.370
the query right in the same place and
look at the examples at the same time.

15
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.891
So I think you'll find this a very useful
way to get comfortable with SQL syntax.

16
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:58.391
Of course when you're in a company, you're
not going to be able to have me there, and

17
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.291
you won't be able to have my examples
right next to you, or at least,

18
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:03.611
not in the exact same place
as your writing inquiries.

19
00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:08.427
So what I suggest you do is you use these
Jupyter MySQL exercises to get really

20
00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:10.391
comfortable with the syntax.

21
00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:14.438
Then once you're ready to be independent,
at the end of each week,

22
00:01:14.438 --> 00:01:16.930
then you move to the Teradata exercises.

23
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.988
The Teradata interface that we use in this
course is very similar to what you would

24
00:01:20.988 --> 00:01:21.890
use in a company.

25
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.630
And in fact, you might end up using the
exact same interface in some companies.

26
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.396
But it does require you to be independent,

27
00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:31.470
you'll have to write your queries from
scratch and you won't have examples there.

28
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.870
So again, what I suggest you do, is start
with MySQL and the Jupyter interface

29
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.770
then move to Teradata when you're
ready to try things on your own.

30
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.000
I'll show you in a later video how
to use the Teradate interface, but

31
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.470
in the next two videos we're
going to focus on Jupyter.

32
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.710
And in this video in particular we're
going to focus on how to work with

33
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.760
the notebook within Jupyter.

34
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.620
So to get started,
what I want you to do, is I want you

35
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.360
click on one of the links in the course
website that goes directly to a notebook.

36
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.140
When you go to one of those links,

37
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.990
it's going to bring you to
a page that looks like this.

38
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.850
When you go to this page,
go ahead and press open Tool.

39
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.171
And when you press that, it's going to
bring up something that looks like this.

40
00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:20.330
Now, each one of these lessons is
contained in what we call a notebook.

41
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.191
And you can see immediately that
the notebook has quite a lot of text.

42
00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:25.819
And if I scroll down,

43
00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.070
you'll see there are also lots of
these places for you to write code.

44
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.171
Here's another one.

45
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:37.099
So the way to use these notebooks or
to go through these lessons,

46
00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.446
is to read the text and
then follow the instructions and

47
00:02:40.446 --> 00:02:44.991
the questions about what to write in
these areas where you can write code.

48
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:49.690
Now just to let you know, each one of
these areas is called a cell in Jupyter.

49
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.592
And I tell you that because I'm going to
show you in a little bit what you can do

50
00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:54.010
with some of these menu options.

51
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.470
And one of the menu
options is called cell.

52
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.880
So this menu option is for each one
of these areas where you write code.

53
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.110
So to give you an idea of what it will
look like when you actually use one

54
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.275
of these code cells, what you're going to
do is you're going to write your query.

55
00:03:13.275 --> 00:03:16.240
And it'll look like this.

56
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.290
And to the left, you're going to see
the word In with some open brackets.

57
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.250
This is what it looks like
before you run your query.

58
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.680
When you're ready to run your query you're
going to press this button up here,

59
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.560
which is the arrow.

60
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.700
And you'll see when you hover
over it it says run cell.

61
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.948
When I press this you're
going to see an asterisk or

62
00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:38.920
a little start that appears
in between these parentheses.

63
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.241
The star is present and
there as long as the query is running.

64
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:48.491
So if you're running a really long query
that takes the database a long time to do,

65
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:51.700
that star will be there
until the output is ready.

66
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.261
This particular query is
going to happen pretty quickly.

67
00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:56.726
So when I run this,
you're going to see the star quickly, and

68
00:03:56.726 --> 00:03:59.160
then right underneath it,
you're going to see the output.

69
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.661
Let's see what that looks like.

70
00:04:00.661 --> 00:04:03.681
You see the star, and now the output.

71
00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:06.744
Now when you run a query
that has a lot of output,

72
00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:09.740
I want to show you a couple
of different things.

73
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.590
This particular query
outputted over 16,000 rows.

74
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.830
However, we have implemented some
safeguards in these Jupyter interfaces so

75
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.160
that you are less likely
to crash the system.

76
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.950
I told you earlier that we had
specifically designed the course, so

77
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.350
that you are each in groups
of about 150 students.

78
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.070
We want you to practice
thinking about your colleagues.

79
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.410
And so, when you write queries
that take a really long time, or

80
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.030
that take a lot resources,
it impacts your colleagues.

81
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.630
In this course, too,
when you run really long queries and

82
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.620
you take a lot of resources, it will
affect everyone else in your group of 150.

83
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.660
It is possible to crash the system for
your group of 150, but

84
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.940
we are giving you some safeguards
to at least make that less likely.

85
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.296
So one of the things we've done here,
is that even though the output has over

86
00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:03.880
16,000 rows, if you scroll down all
the way to the bottom of this output.

87
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.300
You'll see that it says truncated
to display limit of 1000.

88
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.408
We've set this up explicitly so

89
00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:13.241
that you only get 1,000 rows
at a time in your output.

90
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:15.321
Now, I wanted to show you one more thing.

91
00:05:15.321 --> 00:05:20.262
If you had lots of different
columns in your output,

92
00:05:20.262 --> 00:05:23.518
you would also see a bar down here,

93
00:05:23.518 --> 00:05:29.040
a scroll bar down here that
lets you scroll left and right.

94
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.941
So, make sure you number that for
the future.

95
00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:34.980
But, otherwise,
this is what a output will look like.

96
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.080
And you can see that it says In up here,
and IOut down here.

97
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.380
So, this is always where the output is.

98
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.088
A lot of the queries that we run in these

99
00:05:45.088 --> 00:05:49.926
exercises are going to output tables
that have a lot of rows in them.

100
00:05:49.926 --> 00:05:54.552
And because there are that many rows,
it takes a lot of juice for

101
00:05:54.552 --> 00:05:58.406
Jupyter and
the system to keep those tables around.

102
00:05:58.406 --> 00:06:02.169
So if you don't need the output,
if you're not going to learn from it, or

103
00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.624
if you're not going to compare it to other
things you're doing, it's a good idea to

104
00:06:06.624 --> 00:06:10.245
delete that output so that Jupyter
doesn't have to keep it online.

105
00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:16.225
To do that, click on your output, go up to
the Cell menu that I pointed out before.

106
00:06:16.225 --> 00:06:19.165
Go to Current Output > Clear.

107
00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:24.705
And you can see that now the output
from this code cell is no longer there.

108
00:06:24.705 --> 00:06:27.985
But I did want to show you one more
thing in that cell menu that might be

109
00:06:27.985 --> 00:06:28.745
useful to you.

110
00:06:28.745 --> 00:06:31.446
Let's go ahead and run the query again.

111
00:06:31.446 --> 00:06:33.485
And now click on the output.

112
00:06:33.485 --> 00:06:37.686
And first let me point out to you so that
you can see that we can scroll through

113
00:06:37.686 --> 00:06:39.765
the output like I showed you before.

114
00:06:39.765 --> 00:06:44.645
But now go to Cell >
Current Output > Toggle Scrolling.

115
00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:50.146
You can see now the output no longer has
a scrollbar and it has the entire list.

116
00:06:50.146 --> 00:06:56.865
So if you prefer seeing your output
that way you are welcome to do so.

117
00:06:56.865 --> 00:07:03.745
But we've made the default to have
scrolling because it takes less space.

118
00:07:03.745 --> 00:07:07.987
The next thing I want to show you, is what
to do if you start a query that takes

119
00:07:07.987 --> 00:07:11.766
a lot of time to run and you decide
you don't want to run it anymore.

120
00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:15.966
To do that, you can go up to this button.

121
00:07:15.966 --> 00:07:18.446
You hover over it,
it'll say interrupt kernel.

122
00:07:18.446 --> 00:07:21.565
This is basically a stop button.

123
00:07:21.565 --> 00:07:24.840
And so if you are running a query and it
seems to be going forever and you decide,

124
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.085
you know what, I really don't know how
to end need to know the answer to this.

125
00:07:28.085 --> 00:07:31.919
And you're worried about say perhaps,
crashing the system for

126
00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.346
the rest of your group.

127
00:07:33.346 --> 00:07:36.725
Go ahead and click on the query
you're running and press stop.

128
00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:40.930
And you saw it said interrupt kernel, so
the other way you could do that is you

129
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.625
could go to this Kernel dropdown and
you could click on Interrupt.

130
00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:49.478
When you do stop a query it can sometimes
take a little while to stop, so

131
00:07:49.478 --> 00:07:51.880
you do have to be a little patient.

132
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.230
It will then output an error message or
tell you the kernel was interrupted.

133
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.700
And you can start all over again,
and either clear your output, or

134
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.360
add a new cell.

135
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.510
So speaking of a new cell, you've
pretty much seen everything you have to

136
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.650
know to be able to use these notebooks,
but

137
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.270
they actually have a lot more
capability than what I just showed you.

138
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.420
And there's no way for
us to configure these notebooks so

139
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.410
that it's impossible for you to edit them.

140
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.850
So that's a plus, in that it I'll show
you how you can use this as ways to

141
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.500
take notes, and
as ways to share things with each other.

142
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.670
That also means it's possible for
you to edit these notebooks.

143
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.230
Even when it may not be
to your benefit to do so.

144
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.600
So let me show you the good parts first.

145
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.870
Imagine that you wanted to take
some notes about this query.

146
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.419
Each one of these areas that has
code in it is called a cell, but so

147
00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.710
are these areas that have text.

148
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.097
So if I click on this text,

149
00:08:46.097 --> 00:08:49.451
you can see there's kind of a box
here that surrounds the text.

150
00:08:49.451 --> 00:08:51.831
So this is actually a cell as well.

151
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:56.290
And any cell that has text in
it is written in what's called

152
00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.930
markdown language.

153
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.742
So it's a very simple language that is
used in a lot of different programs,,

154
00:09:01.742 --> 00:09:03.631
especially on the web to format text.

155
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:10.390
So what you can do is you can
actually include your own cell.

156
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:15.470
You can insert a cell yourself
that has notes in it.

157
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.651
So if you go to Insert,
you can say Insert Cell Above or Below.

158
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:23.610
We say, Insert Cell Above, you'll
see that it put in the cell for you.

159
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.070
Now you do have to tell it what kind of
input you want to put into that cell.

160
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.250
So if I am clicking on the cell and now I
go up here and I see that it says Code.

161
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.379
What that means is that this cell,
like this one, if I click on this,

162
00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:38.302
you'll see it still says Code,

163
00:09:38.302 --> 00:09:42.170
is configured to be able to
actually write and execute queries.

164
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.750
This cell, on the other hand, when I
click on it, you see it says Markdown.

165
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.602
So if I wanted to put my own notes into
this cell, I would need to go up to

166
00:09:50.602 --> 00:09:55.730
this menu and press Markdown, and
now I can type in whatever text I want.

167
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.890
And I will have this for later.

168
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:10.284
You don't have to run it, but if you
want to format just like you do up here,

169
00:10:10.284 --> 00:10:12.990
then you actually will run the cell.

170
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.810
So I am clicking on the cell and
I am pressing run again.

171
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.031
And now you can see that it's
formatted the same way this is.

172
00:10:19.031 --> 00:10:24.270
So there are a lot of tricks you can
do to format your markdowns cells.

173
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.730
I'll show you in a little bit where you
can go to find out more about that.

174
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.698
Because it's not a major
part of this course,

175
00:10:29.698 --> 00:10:31.220
I don't want to go over the details.

176
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.105
But I am going to show you resources where
you can find all the information you need

177
00:10:35.105 --> 00:10:37.920
to know about how to use markdown
if you decide you want to.

178
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.880
So once you've made cells
you can move them around.

179
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:49.640
You can either use these buttons
here to move a cell up or down.

180
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:55.770
Or you can use this drop-down menu, and
you can say I'm going to cut a cell.

181
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.250
And then you can go to someplace
else in your notebook.

182
00:11:01.011 --> 00:11:01.970
And paste it there.

183
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.630
So you can say, Paste Cell Above, Below,
Paste In Place, all of these options.

184
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.849
Feel free to play around with them.

185
00:11:07.849 --> 00:11:13.011
And this will give you a nice way to be
able to take notes that you can save for

186
00:11:13.011 --> 00:11:13.609
later.

187
00:11:13.609 --> 00:11:18.165
Now, the down side of this, of course,
is even if you don't want to take notes,

188
00:11:18.165 --> 00:11:22.669
it's very easy to mess around with these
tech cells I made for you by accident.

189
00:11:22.669 --> 00:11:26.789
So, if you're clicking around and you
double-click on one of these tech cells,

190
00:11:26.789 --> 00:11:29.910
that's how you start editing on
one of these markdown cells.

191
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.620
You'll see it suddenly
starts to look like this.

192
00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.020
It'll look a little weird.

193
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.650
This is the text written
in markdown language.

194
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.990
And so if this happens to you,
don't worry.

195
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.670
Don't panic.

196
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.620
All you need to do is
press the run button and

197
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.730
it'll go back again to
looking like normal.

198
00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.470
So just to show you that one more time, if
by accident you click on one of the text

199
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.270
cells and you double click, this gives
you an opportunity to edit the text cell.

200
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.040
So if you don't want to do that,
press the run button again and

201
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.880
it will look like it did when
you first received the notebook.

202
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.412
As you are drafting with the notebook,

203
00:12:04.412 --> 00:12:08.500
Jupyter will automatically
be saving changes.

204
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.680
But you can also save them yourself.

205
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.183
So if you go up to File > Save and
Checkpoint,

206
00:12:16.183 --> 00:12:20.460
that will save the workbook
as you made it.

207
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.820
And it will also make what
is called a Checkpoint.

208
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.011
Checkpoints are a specific
point in time and

209
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:32.860
what Jupyter does it saves exactly
how the notebook looks at the time.

210
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.090
What that allows you to do, is if you
start playing around and then mess things

211
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.600
up or don't like what you've done, you
can go up to File > Revert to Checkpoint.

212
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.077
And it will give you a list of
the different checkpoints you've made and

213
00:12:46.077 --> 00:12:50.120
you can choose any one of them to
go back to where you were before.

214
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.404
And it will give you this option, so
you can choose to either revert or not,

215
00:12:54.404 --> 00:12:57.481
as it tells you,
if you do revert it can't be undone.

216
00:12:57.481 --> 00:13:00.686
So make sure if you do go back to
a checkpoint you know you want you

217
00:13:00.686 --> 00:13:01.421
want to do so.

218
00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:03.340
So, we'll press Cancel.

219
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.240
Now before I show you what the next
set of things about Jupyter,

220
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:12.180
there's a very important aspect of this
interface that you should know about.

221
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.240
And that is the Help.

222
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.160
Jupyter has a great help resource.

223
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.628
Two different things that you should focus
on in particular, but feel free to look

224
00:13:21.628 --> 00:13:25.180
around any of these things, actually
there are three things you should know.

225
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.840
First of all, there's an interface tour
that I think you'll find very useful, so

226
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.710
I suggest you take a look at that.

227
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:34.213
But you can also look at
either this Notebook Help or

228
00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:39.030
this Markdown documentation,
both of which are very, very useful.

229
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:44.653
So if we click on say Markdown Help,
it will bring you to this webpage where

230
00:13:44.653 --> 00:13:49.660
it gives you all kinds of instructions
about how to use markdown.

231
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.620
So this is where you should
go if you want to start

232
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:59.340
playing around with how
you edit your cells.

233
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.511
Another thing that's very useful
is the Notebook Help, and

234
00:14:03.511 --> 00:14:08.920
that's gives you all kind of sections that
tell you all about how to run a code.

235
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.460
The basics.

236
00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.261
Really if you have any questions,
this is where you should go.

237
00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:17.860
This is the best place to
find out any of your answers.

238
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.645
The last thing I want to show you before
we go our home menu Is how to save your

239
00:14:22.645 --> 00:14:27.840
notebooks, or print or export them so
that you can look at them in another way.

240
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.781
Or so
that you can share them with each other.

241
00:14:29.781 --> 00:14:32.740
And to do that, go to File.

242
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.521
And there are a couple of
different options for you.

243
00:14:35.521 --> 00:14:38.821
So you can either download your
notebook as an iPython notebook.

244
00:14:38.821 --> 00:14:43.310
And I'll show you later how you can
upload these into your home directory.

245
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.730
This provides a way for you guys in
the course to interact with each other and

246
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.810
to share queries with each other and
share what you're learning.

247
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:55.150
So that you can write
your own text here and

248
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.450
show each other what queries are having
and then you can help each other out.

249
00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.990
Another thing you can do is you
can save your notebook as a PDF.

250
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:06.358
So one way to do that is to go to
the Download part of the menu and

251
00:15:06.358 --> 00:15:08.080
click on PDF via LaTeX.

252
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.280
But this is actually not
my favorite way to do it.

253
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.234
Because sometimes the LaTeX
formatting is very spread out and

254
00:15:14.234 --> 00:15:15.760
can take a lot of pages.

255
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.356
So my preferred way to do it
is to go to Print Preview,

256
00:15:18.356 --> 00:15:20.961
which will give you something
that looks like this.

257
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:23.115
And this will be much more compact, and

258
00:15:23.115 --> 00:15:25.541
will give you fewer
pages in your print out.

259
00:15:25.541 --> 00:15:28.920
So once you get this,
you can go to File > Print.

260
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.810
And this next screen will look
different on everybody's computer

261
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.370
because everyone will have a different
configuration, and you might have a Mac or

262
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.400
PC, and so
this will look a little different.

263
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.920
But there should always be some
option to be able to print to a PDF.

264
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.056
So that will let you save a file for later
so that you can look at your queries or

265
00:15:44.056 --> 00:15:44.680
your notes.

266
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.920
Or will let you print them out so that you
can look at them while you are studying.

267
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:51.980
Nice work.

268
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.210
You now know how to use
a Jupyter notebook.

269
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.960
In the next video, I'm going to show
you how you can use the home page

270
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.680
of your Jupiter account to make new
notebooks, rename notebooks and

271
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.350
share notebooks with one another.

272
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.200
I'll see you in the next video.
