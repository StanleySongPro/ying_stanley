00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.050
In 1938 William T Dillard founded
a store in Nashville Arkansas,

2
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.400
a southern state of the United States.

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.230
Today, that store has grown into
approximately 300 department stores

4
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.920
in 29 states across
United States of America, and

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.660
each one of those stores has
the same name, Dillard's.

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.430
Pictured here is one of our local
Dillard's stores in North Carolina.

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.950
Dillard's sells all kinds of merchandise,
from clothing, to accessories,

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.300
to home decor.

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.170
It has departments targeted towards women,

10
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.850
as well as departments
targeted towards men.

11
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.620
It is a very popular place to shop.

12
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.240
Luckily, for us in this class, it is also
a store that collects a lot of data.

13
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.640
Like most stores, when you are ready
to purchase an item in Dillard's,

14
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.020
you bring it to a sales associate
working at a cash register.

15
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.880
The sales associate will take the item and
use the bar code reader to

16
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.670
scan the bar code on the tag that
took the store attached the item.

17
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.770
This information from the bar code is sent
to a centralized database where it is

18
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.000
stored in a transaction table.

19
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.960
When the customer pays for

20
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.320
the item, the payment details are also
sent to the transaction table.

21
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.490
The receipt is printed and
the transaction is completed.

22
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.540
Hundreds of millions of purchase
transactions are recorded at

23
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.980
Dillard's per year.

24
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.794
This provides a terrific opportunity to
use business analytics tools to learn what

25
00:01:14.794 --> 00:01:16.767
factors influence customer purchasing.

26
00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:21.426
In this course, we are extraordinarily
fortunate to have a year of Dillard's

27
00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:25.601
sales transaction data from
August 2004 through July 2005.

28
00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:30.017
The transaction data includes exactly what
items were included in each transaction,

29
00:01:30.017 --> 00:01:35.120
how much they cost, when the purchase was
made, and where the purchase was made.

30
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.060
Additionally, there are census
information about the metropolitan's

31
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.690
statistical area surrounding the store
in which the purchase was made.

32
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.140
This information is spread across
six tables ranging from 60 to

33
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.430
over 120 million rows and size.

34
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.460
Dillard's donated this data set to
the Walton School of Business at

35
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.510
the University of Arkansas.

36
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.830
Walton school of business has very
generously agreed to partner with us to

37
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.110
provide students in this course with
the opportunity to practice querying and

38
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.920
analyzing a real enterprise data set.

39
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.320
Dillard's has become very interested
in data analytics over the years.

40
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.010
So use this data set as an opportunity to
get a sense of what it would feel like

41
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.500
to work for a very big company who
truly values making business decisions

42
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.530
based on insight from a very big data.
