1
00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:08.529
We are really fortunate in this class
to be able to work with a real business

2
00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.480
dataset from a real business.

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.400
That business is called Dognition.

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.000
And today we have Elliot Cohen,
producer at Dognition,

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.379
coming in to tell us about
the dataset he donated to us.

6
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.540
Hi Elliot.
>> Hey.

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.520
>> Thanks for coming in.

8
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.240
>> It's great to meet you.

9
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.890
>> Who's this?

10
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.710
>> This is Sizou.

11
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.540
>> Hi Sizou.

12
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.270
Thanks so much for coming in.

13
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.570
>> Oh, it was our pleasure.

14
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.310
>> Both of you have a seat.

15
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.120
Great, well thanks again.

16
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.490
So could you tell us a little bit about
Dognition and what role you play there?

17
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.510
>> Sure.
Dognition is a way for dog owners and

18
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.510
dog lovers all over the world
to learn more about their dogs.

19
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.420
We have taken laboratory games that are
done in labs and dog cognition labs all

20
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.370
over the country and all over the world,
and we have basically broken

21
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.340
them down to their components and
recreated them using household objects

22
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.380
that anyone can use finding whatever
they have in their house at home.

23
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.270
And then we aggregate all this data.

24
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.460
We have over 30,000 people who
are playing Dognition Games now.

25
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.570
And we look at it as a group, and now
we've recently published our first paper

26
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.140
which says that our data is
as good as laboratory data.

27
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.470
In terms of what the users, though, dog
owners who play Dognition get, you really

28
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.950
get to learn a lot more about your dog
that you wouldn't necessarily know.

29
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.380
I know a lot of people come in and
they think, oh gosh, what am I going to?

30
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.008
I know my dog's smart or
I know my dog's dumb.

31
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:27.690
But even Dr. Hare, who designed the games,
learned a lot more about his dog Tasmania.

32
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.270
So for example,
Tasmania he expected would have

33
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.800
a very active memory and would be
able to recall things very easily.

34
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.900
But it turns out, she doesn't really
rely on her memory that much,

35
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.830
she relies on him.

36
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.440
So when he's telling her sit and
then she walks away it's not because she's

37
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.640
disregarding what he's saying, she
actually just can't remember what he said.

38
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.330
So this is an example of
something you'll gain through

39
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.010
learning the proper skills
that your dog relies on.

40
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.410
So the Dognition games
themselves are broken down into

41
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.450
five dimensions of canine intelligence.

42
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.650
The dimensions are empathy, communication,
cunning, memory, and reasoning.

43
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.260
And then across these five dimensions we
have 20 games, or really 10 games and

44
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.270
10 warm ups.

45
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.000
Which then contribute to
those dimensional scores.

46
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.680
Which will determine not if your
dog uses memory or doesn't,

47
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.680
but what skills within
memory your dog relies on.

48
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.580
And then from these, your dog will
be placed into one of nine profiles.

49
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.710
And these profiles are a combination
of different traits.

50
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.940
And they, what we found, which was very
interesting to begin with is your breed

51
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.290
doesn't determine very much about what
profile your dog will end up being.

52
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.770
It's all about the individual way
your dog is solving problems.

53
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.140
>> So what does it actually look
like when you log in to the website?

54
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.062
>> So to log in to Dognition, you just
go to the log in button and wait for

55
00:02:46.062 --> 00:02:51.171
it to load, and then you log in with
whatever your user name and password is.

56
00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.490
And then, what you see right here,
this is what a completed dog sees.

57
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.830
So right in your home page, it shows you
all the dimensions you've completed.

58
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.340
It shows you your next
monthly game over here.

59
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.110
Here's your activities.

60
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.910
And here's your survey corner, which is
like 150 additional questions which people

61
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.400
really like to answer, because people
like to answer questions about their dog.

62
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.940
This is where the report would be.

63
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.370
So there are 15 pages of analysis and
then we go back to the games.

64
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.852
This is a completed dog and
all the completed dimensions and

65
00:03:24.852 --> 00:03:26.820
all the completed results.

66
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:35.070
So if we looked at a incomplete dog, we
can see this is Kyle, up here in the top.

67
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.820
So the way we'd get here,

68
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.260
we go from the home page, right here,
you see it says, UP NEXT, Play The Games.

69
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.720
And here we are.

70
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.130
This is the game that's next.

71
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.960
It shows you the completed
games on the side.

72
00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:49.178
Cunning's the game he's up to.

73
00:03:49.178 --> 00:03:54.360
On the top it says click play, so you
click play and go to right into the games.

74
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.920
Up here ahead you see
the games you haven't yet

75
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.320
unlocked to play because you
need to play them in order, and

76
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.890
it reminds you that you need to complete
them previous dimension in order to play.

77
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.330
>> So what kind of subscription
models do you have?

78
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.230
>> Dognition offers three types
of subscriptions as ways to play

79
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.290
the Dognition games.

80
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.580
We have the core Dognition assessment and
this is 10 games and

81
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.530
10 tests, or warm-ups, that contribute
to your dog's Dognition profile,

82
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.130
which is one of those nine things that
ends up that your dog is afterwards.

83
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.150
On top of this, we have the Dognition
yearly and monthly subscriptions.

84
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.850
And these are exciting additional
things that you can do with your

85
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.160
dog after you complete the assessment,
which really are two things.

86
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.590
You have 12 additional games
over the course of the year,

87
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.160
as well as 12 additional activities
that are created by experts or trainers.

88
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.080
And these games unlock, games and

89
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.670
activities unlock on a monthly basis
from when you sign up, one per month.

90
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.220
>> Okay.
So if I understand correctly,

91
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.430
each customer has the opportunity to
complete 20 tests in the first month and

92
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.440
they do it in the same order each time,
one by one as you make them available.

93
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.372
Is that right?

94
00:05:01.372 --> 00:05:06.540
>> The Dognition games were designed to
go in this particular order and starting

95
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.370
with empathy, you go into communication
and cunning and memory and reasoning.

96
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.660
The reason for this was two-fold.

97
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.870
One, the empathy games
are actually our simplest games.

98
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.820
They don't require anything other
than you and your dog and for

99
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.610
the eye contact and
you require treats, but there's

100
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.970
no training that you need to do in terms
of getting a dog used to doing these.

101
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.770
It's just you and your dog hanging out.

102
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.340
This is helpful because you
don't need to worry about if

103
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.950
your dog is over excited,
it will be a calming experience, and

104
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.270
that will really get your dog in the mood
to play the games going forward.

105
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.780
After that the other thing that happen is
that games full to get more complicated,

106
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.660
so we've found be better to ramp it up.

107
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.720
>> Did you ever try making a test
available in the different order?

108
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.590
>> About six months after launch for
Dognition,

109
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.250
we were looking closely at how
our product was performing

110
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.240
in terms of completion rates and we
realized, it wasn't so much we realized,

111
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.580
we weren't happy with how
far people were progressing.

112
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.570
There was a very large
drop-off in the beginning and

113
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.530
not as many people as we wanted were
getting all the way through to the end.

114
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.550
To try to address this, we,
our hypothesis was that people

115
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.770
weren't enjoying the empathy dimension as
much, because while it was very easy and

116
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.810
it was easy to get people into the games,
it wasn't exactly exciting.

117
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.350
And we knew this because we designed and

118
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.510
implemented an additional
enjoyment/surprise survey.

119
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.310
So using the information we got from that,
we developed an alternate hypothesis which

120
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.150
was instead of leading with empathy,
we would lead with the memory dimension.

121
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.080
Which was scored as more enjoyable and

122
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.830
very surprising in terms of
the expectation versus what happened.

123
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.010
The drawback to this, which we realized
after, is because while the overall

124
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.980
completion rate and advancement didn't
change, it did change how far people got.

125
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.480
Some more people got through
the first dimension but

126
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.490
that didn't mean they got further.

127
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.900
And the draw back of the memory
dimension was that it's a very

128
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.530
technical dimension in terms of what
the instructions are asking you to do.

129
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.570
And if the dog isn't using a strategy
that results in them getting a treat,

130
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.530
then they aren't going to
get any treats at all.

131
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.600
So that get's very frustrating for
the owners and the dogs.

132
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.910
So that's some insight into
one of our earlier tests.

133
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.230
>> So now here's the million
dollar question Elliot.

134
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.870
What business problem does that mission
have that you think we might be able to

135
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.570
help you with?

136
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.970
>> The mission as a product and

137
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.320
a company is really broken into
two components, at the most basic.

138
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.340
We have what we call the brochure,
which is the outside non logged in version

139
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.210
of what you see which is
our website you go through.

140
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.780
You have the homepage, how it works and

141
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.670
then a thousand other pages trying to give
you more information if you're interested.

142
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.700
And then we have
the actual product itself,

143
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.620
which is after you log in,
the issues to do with playing the games or

144
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.600
interacting with the trainers or the
experts or any number of things in there.

145
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.150
So that gives us two very distinct areas
of development that we can focus on.

146
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.670
At Dognition,
we have an interesting problem

147
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.330
where we actually care a lot about what
our customers do after they purchase.

148
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.550
We don't, once you give us your
money that's fantastic, but

149
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.400
we actually want you to do a lot
with Dognition as a product.

150
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.680
And this comes in to we
really want you to finish.

151
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.110
If you don't finish, then we only get
a tiny amount of your data and the overall

152
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.650
goal of Dognition is to publish papers and
learn more about your dog.

153
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.760
And your contributions are helpful
in keeping us running but

154
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.110
at the end of the day, if we don't have
your data then we don't have anything.

155
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.580
So one of the main things we're
looking is ways to increase,

156
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.100
in some respects their completion rate.

157
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.790
But really just get people further
along in their Dognition experience and

158
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:39.450
through the games.

159
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.020
We do, can do a lot partial analysis or
we'll look at just a people who have

160
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.290
completed the first section of the game or
just the PQ or just anything like that.

161
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.707
But really what we're really looking for
is this huge comparison that could we

162
00:08:51.707 --> 00:08:54.879
could look for your breed or any number
of things across all of the games.

163
00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:59.000
So anything that we can find about
some insight to push users and

164
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.170
their dogs to complete a bit more would
be super helpful from our perspective.

165
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.480
>> So do you have any tips for a class
as we tackle this business problem?

166
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.190
>> Actually I do have a tip in
terms of doing the data analysis.

167
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.130
The most important thing that we've
found is that you have to go on every

168
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.630
test with a question.

169
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.780
You need to have a hypothesis and

170
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.640
you need to know exactly what
you're doing to test that.

171
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.820
because if you're just going in and
looking,

172
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.690
either you're going to find things that
don't matter, which is useless, or,

173
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.410
you're not going to find anything,
which is equally useless.

174
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.740
So, find a testable
hypothesis before you go in,

175
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.310
is the only really
important thing I'd say.

176
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.260
>> Great, so

177
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.910
do yo think you'd be willing to show
us an example of one of your tests?

178
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.760
>> Yeah, sure So I'm going to show guys,
the memory pointing game.

179
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.650
I think this is a great example
of how Dognition is trying to see

180
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.920
what strategy a dog uses.

181
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.300
Not that there's a right or
a wrong answer.

182
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:50.500
This is a pretty far to the games,
it's near the end of the memory dimension.

183
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.860
And what this will do is
I'll put down some cups and

184
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.680
I'll hide a piece of food
under one of the cups and

185
00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.430
then I will stand up and point to
the cup where I didn't hide the treat.

186
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.940
And this will directly point my
information the dog is learning from

187
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.800
my actions versus where it knows the treat
is and where it remembers that it is.

188
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:14.335
So let's see what happens, so we do is we
put the two cups down, the dog is across.

189
00:10:14.335 --> 00:10:20.922
Sizou, show the treat,
put it under a cup and then get the treat.

190
00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:27.080
So the side that she goes
to first is what she gets.

191
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.754
So she knew that that's where treat was
even though I pointed to the other side.

192
00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:37.306
>> What make Dognition excited
to share their data with us and

193
00:10:37.306 --> 00:10:39.040
to be part of this course?

194
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.920
>> One of the things that Dognition
is really big on is education and

195
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.290
we want to share information about dogs.

196
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.580
And if we have enough data and

197
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.260
we have enough experience we can
share some data or info about how to

198
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.510
make data driven decisions then,
we ended up being very happy to help.

199
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.360
The one thing that was really important
from our perspective, when you're sharing

200
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.250
your data, is that we take care of
ourselves and we take care of our users.

201
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.610
So, all of the data that
we shared was anonymized.

202
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:10.480
There was no reference to individual
users and no references to addresses or

203
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.980
emails or anything at all that
would identify an individual

204
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.240
has been scrubbed from the data so
there's no tracing back to anyone.

205
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.930
>> Now that you have learned about
the business problem we have to solve

206
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.610
together, go to the course website to find
out some more details about the specific

207
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.230
fields we have in the database set that
Elliot and Dognition so kindly donated.

208
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.100
In the mean time, I suggest you go
check out the Dognition website.

209
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.400
It's really a cool company, and

210
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.130
I think you'll really get excited
about solving their business problems.
