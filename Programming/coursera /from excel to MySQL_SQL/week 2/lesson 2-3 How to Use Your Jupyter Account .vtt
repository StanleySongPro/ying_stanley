00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.120
Hey guys, welcome back.

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.030
In this video, we're going to go over
how to use the homepage of your Jupyter

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.410
account to make new notebooks,
rename them, reorganize them, and

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.020
share them with one another.

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.735
To get started,

6
00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:18.703
I want you to go back to exactly where
we left off after the last video.

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.270
So, if we go back to our notebook here.

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.310
This is the interface for
our Exercise 2 notebook.

9
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.260
But if you want to go back
to your home directory where

10
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.530
all the notebooks are held,
click on the Jupyter icon right here.

11
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.970
When I click this, it brings me to
this page, which is my home directory.

12
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.050
And you'll see all of the notebooks for

13
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.610
the course are listed here,
all 12 of them.

14
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.490
And there's also an option here,

15
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.070
a notebook called Restore-my-notebook,
which I'll explain in a little bit.

16
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.900
So in this interface, if you click on
the box next to one of these notebooks,

17
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.280
you'll see that you have
a couple of different options.

18
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.840
You can duplicate it.

19
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.090
You can shut it down and
you can also get rid of it,

20
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.510
if you wanted to, which I don't suggest
doing, but you could, if you wanted to.

21
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.520
So if you press duplicate,
it'll ask you if you really

22
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.360
want to do that, and
you'll see that it made a copy here.

23
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.590
Then you could get rid of that copy.

24
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.160
Make sure you only have the one you
actually want to get rid of here.

25
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.309
And so, then you can press this little,

26
00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:37.860
this button here and press Delete.

27
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.240
Now you'll see that these two notebooks
and this notebook are green or

28
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.670
have a green note next to them and
also have the word running next to them.

29
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.430
If you click on this Running tab,
it will list for

30
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.480
you all of the notebooks that
you currently have open.

31
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.420
So I opened some of these notebooks before
I started giving you this demo, and

32
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.660
so all of them are currently open.

33
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.870
It's a good idea for you, and for
the rest of your group of 100 and,

34
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.440
about 150 students and also for
our resources here at Duke for

35
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.820
you to shutdown your notebooks
when you're not using them.

36
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.670
It will save everything you've done.

37
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.060
So even if you don't clear the output,
it'll save the output, and

38
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.717
if you've cleared the output,

39
00:02:23.717 --> 00:02:28.130
it will still save the queries you wrote
and save any of the cells you wrote.

40
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.630
So all you're doing when you're pressing
Shutdown is helping to preserve resources.

41
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.790
You're not going to lose any of the work.

42
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.940
So we'd really appreciate if when you're
not using your notebooks you shut

43
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.450
them down in between.

44
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.740
So the easiest way to do that is to go
to this Running tab and press Shutdown.

45
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.890
But I'll show you you can also
do it on the Files tab so

46
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.250
if I wanted to close this one,
I can click this check mark box and

47
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.100
I can say shutdown here as well, and
now you can see it's no longer running.

48
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.540
Another part of this screen that you
might find useful is over here and

49
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.550
you can actually create
your own notebooks.

50
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.830
So if you wanted to take some notes or
you wanted to try some new things and you

51
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.470
wanted to do it in a completely separate
notebook than the ones we've provided,

52
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.310
you can go over to here to New and
you could either create a text file,

53
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.600
if you wanted to keep notes that way,
or you can create your own notebook.

54
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.060
If you are going to create a new notebook,
choose the Python 3 option.

55
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.113
So let's go ahead and create a new one.

56
00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:34.176
And it'll bring you to a screen like this,
you can change the title up here.

57
00:03:42.812 --> 00:03:46.486
And you can add new cells as you like,
and again,

58
00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:51.870
you would want to change this to
Markdown or Code as you see appropriate.

59
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.660
Let's go back to our home screen.

60
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.983
And let's go ahead and close down this
new notebook we just ran or we just made.

61
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.947
The other thing I'd like to
show you is this button here,

62
00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:08.500
which is the Upload button.

63
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.410
So this is how you guys can share your
Jupyter notebooks with each other.

64
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.920
So if you click on Upload,
it will give you a navigation screen and

65
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.450
you can navigate to wherever you've
saved notebooks, and once you find one,

66
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.760
you can press Choose, and it will bring
it right into your home screen here.

67
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.010
So that will provide a great way for
you guys to work together.

68
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.590
The last thing I want to show you is
this Restore-my-notebooks notebook.

69
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.650
We've provided this because, if you
start playing around too much with your

70
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.680
notebooks, it is possible that you could
get yourself into a situation where you've

71
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.820
just added so many different things.

72
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.660
Or somehow you've gotten into a place
where your queries won't stop running and

73
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.440
everything seems to be crashing.

74
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.460
You can restore all of your notebooks
again, as if you were just starting for

75
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.640
the first time.

76
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.220
However, if you do that,

77
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.300
it will restore all of your notebooks,
not just one of them.

78
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.190
So if you click on Restore-my-notebooks,
it's actually going to bring you to

79
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.540
a new notebook and
you'll see the instructions here.

80
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.880
What you're going to do is
if you want to use this,

81
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.210
you're going to run this
line of code here, so

82
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.530
you would run the cell and then you
would run it by pressing this button.

83
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.930
But as it says here,
if you want to do this,

84
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.110
if you want to save any of your work from
the previous notebooks you were using,

85
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.120
you have to rename the notebooks otherwise
they're going to get overwritten.

86
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.900
So make sure you know how to do that.

87
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.139
You can do that using
the Rename button here.

88
00:05:51.657 --> 00:05:52.840
And it would look like that.

89
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.780
Another thing that might be useful to you,
if you do start making a lot of your own

90
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.930
notebooks, is that you can make folders
within your home directory here.

91
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.540
This functionality is a little bit
cumbersome if you're not used to coding,

92
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.110
but I'll show you just in case
it would be useful to you.

93
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.250
So if you go to New,
you can click on Folder.

94
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.900
And it'll make a folder here.

95
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.380
You can then click to the left, click
on Rename, call it something different.

96
00:06:31.685 --> 00:06:35.513
But then if you wanted to put any
of these notebooks into a folder,

97
00:06:35.513 --> 00:06:37.400
it's a little bit cumbersome.

98
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.240
Click on Rename.

99
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.600
My goal is going to be to put this
notebook into My Practice Notebooks.

100
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.050
Click on Rename, and now what you have to
do is, you have to type in the name of

101
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:55.653
the folder before the name
of your notebook,

102
00:06:55.653 --> 00:07:01.830
so My Practice Notebooks,
and then put a backslash.

103
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:09.690
Press OK, you'll see that my new
notebook is no longer there.

104
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.050
If I press on this folder,
there's my new notebook.

105
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.090
To get back to the home screen,
press this little house button, and

106
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.540
that brings you back to your home screen.

107
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.209
The last thing you need to know is
if you do decide to rename these

108
00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:30.000
original notebooks that we've provided for
you with the course, you will not be

109
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.440
able to access them directly from
the link in the Coursera course website.

110
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.200
You'll have to go, they're two different
types of links in the Coursera website.

111
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.530
There's a link that allows you to go to
a specific lesson or a specific notebook.

112
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.750
And there's also a link that
let's you go to your homepage.

113
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.710
The link that goes to a specific
lesson will no longer work

114
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.440
if you change the name of that lesson.

115
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.550
But you can still go to the link
that goes to your homepage.

116
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.530
So make sure you remember that if you
do decide to rename these lessons for

117
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.060
some reason.

118
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.000
Well done.
You now know everything you need to

119
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.330
know about how to use Jupyter for
this course.

120
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.640
The next step is to go
the course materials and

121
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.050
click on the link to MySQL exercise one,
looking at your data.

122
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.460
I'll see you in the next video when you're
ready to learn how to use tera data.

123
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.540
Good luck and have fun.
