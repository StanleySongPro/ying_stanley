1
00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:06.760
Last week, we learned how
databases are organized, and

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.459
practiced how to make and interpret ER
diagrams and relational schemas, in order

3
00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:14.350
to figure out how the data you want to
analyze are stored in the database.

4
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.480
This week we are going to
start writing SQL queries.

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.120
One of the first things you're going
to learn is how to write queries that

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.040
are considerate to your coworkers.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.750
We are going to write queries that analyze
two sets of data from two real companies.

8
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.120
One dataset, donated from a local
startup in Durham, North Carolina,

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.550
called Dognition has tables
with over 1 million rows.

10
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.280
The other data set,
donated from a national US department

11
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.710
store chain called Dilliard's,
has tables with over 100 million rows.

12
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.510
An important thing to keep in mind
when working with data of this size,

13
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.280
is that the queries you write
will affect the speed at which

14
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.820
other people in the company
can retrieve data.

15
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.700
This means that the opportunities
you have to query a company's raw

16
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.580
data from its database are accompanied by
a responsibility to write queries that

17
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.130
impact others as little as possible.

18
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.950
To give you practice with what
this responsibility feels like,

19
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.770
the queries you will write in this course,

20
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.270
like those you'll write in a company, will
affect other people's database experience.

21
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.840
We have built the MySQL
database infrastructure for

22
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.970
this course to provide database access
to groups of about 150 students each.

23
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.850
When you right a query that is extremely
resource intensive, it can slow down or

24
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.400
even crash database access for
everyone else in your group of a 150 or

25
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.630
so students.

26
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.148
And if does crash, don't worry,
of course we'll restart it for you.

27
00:01:27.148 --> 00:01:30.260
We had purposely designed the course
this way to give you an opportunity

28
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.070
in a safe environment to learn the
consequences of writing intensive queries.

29
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.560
We hope this will help motivate
you to adopt practices that will

30
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.420
prevent you from writing these types of
queries in the future when you are working

31
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.870
with databases in your own companies.

32
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.070
Another important thing you are going
to learn in the first MySQL lesson

33
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.440
is how to use SQL queries to verity and
describe all the contents in a database.

34
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.510
Two common ways you can accidentally write
queries that take a very long time to run

35
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.960
are by asking a database to
return all the data in a really,

36
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.520
really large table even though you
don't need all the data in that table.

37
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.657
Or by asking a database to combine tables
whose output has many more rows than you

38
00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.932
expect due to many-to-many
relationships in your columns or

39
00:02:07.932 --> 00:02:09.613
duplicate values in your rows.

40
00:02:09.613 --> 00:02:12.262
Therefore, one of the best
ways to prevent yourself from

41
00:02:12.262 --> 00:02:16.950
writing queries that are unnecessarily
taxing, is to know your data in detail.

42
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.330
If you know which tables are large, and
you know what to expect when you combine

43
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.950
information from different tables, you'll
be less likely to unintentionally write

44
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.880
queries that make the database work
really hard for no useful reason.

45
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.440
To prepare you to write these types of
queries, the next two videos will tell you

46
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.900
all about the datasets
we will be working with.

47
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.140
The following videos will show you how
to interact with those data ets through

48
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.600
the user interfaces we set up for
the course.

49
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.270
Then you will spend the rest of
the week using these interfaces to

50
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.630
practice queries.

51
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.960
By the end of the week,
you will be able to learn about and

52
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.040
describe all the contents
of a database and

53
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.290
will be able to export data from specific
tables in a socially responsible way.

54
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.630
It's going to be a very productive week,
so I hope you're ready to learn.

55
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.120
Watch the next two videos about
your datasets to get started.
