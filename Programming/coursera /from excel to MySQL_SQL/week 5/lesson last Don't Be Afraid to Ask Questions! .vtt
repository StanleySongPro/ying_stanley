1
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.120
Congratulations on becoming a data
analyst who can officially claim

2
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.840
to know how to use SQL.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.560
Your perseverance through all
the queries you've now mastered

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.730
has significantly increased your earning
potential as well as your ability to

5
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.080
provide real value to your business.

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.770
In doing so, I hope it has also inspired
you to learn more about databases and

7
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.340
give you confidence that, with a little
hard work, you can learn all kinds of new

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.030
things about the data and technology
world that can enhance your career.

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.420
If you've gone through all
the exercises in this course,

10
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.680
you know enough to immediately
start using SQL in your job.

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.840
As you do that, though, you might find you
have new questions about how to design

12
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.040
queries or make them more efficient.

13
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.360
You have at least a couple approaches
available to you in these situations.

14
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.170
The first is the Internet.

15
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.110
The Internet has a wealth of resources
to help you learn SQL functions in

16
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.090
different ways.

17
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.410
Or you can ask an online community for
advice on how to handle specific problems.

18
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.520
One of the most popular
resources developers and

19
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.960
learners use is stackoverflow.com,
which defines itself as a collaboratively

20
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.610
edited question and
answer site for programmers.

21
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.320
Any time you have a SQL question,
my advice is to search this site first.

22
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.610
There's a very good chance somebody else
has already had the same question or

23
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.570
similar problem so you will be
able to see how they solved it.

24
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.310
You can also post new questions.

25
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.350
When you do, multiple people in
the programming community usually respond

26
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.869
to help you out.

27
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.540
Another course of action you can take when
you have a SQL question or run into a SQL

28
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.130
problem is to ask for help from other
programmers at your own workplace.

29
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.690
Especially because they will know
your company's database environment

30
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.680
better than anybody on the internet.

31
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.320
Now I know that might sound a little
bit scary to do at first because

32
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.060
you are worried that you are supposed
to know everything about databases by

33
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.530
the time you're hired for an analyst job.

34
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.760
I want to assure you that that
is decidedly not the case.

35
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.950
The tech world moves so quickly,
that nobody knows every analytics or

36
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.900
programming tool out there anymore.

37
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.130
There simply aren't enough hours in
the day to learn every single program and

38
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.810
every single language, and data driven
companies know this particularly well.

39
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.220
That's precisely why it is so

40
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.670
important to job recruiters,
to hire people who are eager to learn.

41
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.340
For self motivated trying new things, and
who aren't intimidated by the prospect of

42
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.000
applying new tools they just
learned to the real situations.

43
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.910
What recruiters want to see is
that you get yourself in there and

44
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.960
work your way through problems,
not that you know everything.

45
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.360
Here's Ryan Luecke again, sharing his
experience about when he joined Box.

46
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.330
>> I definitely feel comfortable asking
people at Box for help on the job.

47
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.790
I didn't actually start out knowing
anything about web applications.

48
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.480
Databases was the only operative course
I did not take at my university and

49
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.460
so I do have a lot of questions
when it comes to databases.

50
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.450
However, the people at
Box are super helpful and

51
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.470
willing to share what they know and
I owe them a lot of what I know now.

52
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.750
And that's been crucial.

53
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.258
Okay, my experience is that since people
don't expect you to know everything,

54
00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:55.319
in reality, asking is okay.

55
00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.686
In fact, a lot of the most senior
engineers ask a lot of questions because

56
00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:02.670
it's not possible to know everything.

57
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.340
Even if you were really smart or

58
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.020
you had a lot of experience in a lot of
areas you won't be kept up to date on

59
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.460
everything there is to know about every
piece of technology and every database.

60
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.728
Oh, wow.
Hold on a second these lights are dimming.

61
00:03:16.728 --> 00:03:20.440
This is bizarre.

62
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.480
And this is like a new building?

63
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.129
I mean, a new office?

64
00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.810
I'm going to jack up the lights in here.

65
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.880
I think I just haven't moved.

66
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.440
>> I was particularly eager to share
that last clip with you because it shows

67
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.400
that even a senior engineer at Box
can have technological problems;

68
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.280
even problems as simple
as turning on the lights.

69
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.170
Once Ryan got the lights back on,
he had this helpful parting thought.

70
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.460
>> So don't be afraid to learn.

71
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.270
And to ask questions.

72
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.620
And to find colleagues and

73
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.520
people who will help you because
no one is born knowing it.

74
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.990
You're going to have
to learn it somewhere.

75
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.380
>> Upon hearing this advice from Ryan and
I, you might be thinking okay, fine.

76
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.310
Maybe it's okay to ask questions but
what if I make a mistake?

77
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.042
Won't people think I'm unqualified and

78
00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:01.881
wonder why they hired
me in the first place?

79
00:04:01.881 --> 00:04:03.300
That is a very common concern for

80
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.400
people who are new to the technology
side of the business world.

81
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.560
But that too is not something
you should worry too much about.

82
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.580
The tech world is so reliant on
people's ability to learn new things,

83
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.930
that people make mistakes all the time.

84
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.860
Here's Elena Grewal,
Data Science Manager at Air BNB,

85
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.160
sharing her perspective about
making mistakes on the job.

86
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.094
>> So there are so
many times we have gotten things wrong.

87
00:04:25.094 --> 00:04:27.601
So I have many examples of that.

88
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:31.972
That said, I think a really
important culture to have on

89
00:04:31.972 --> 00:04:36.960
any team is the culture of
bringing forward any errors.

90
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.500
And, that being celebrated,

91
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.600
that we understand that
everyone will make mistakes.

92
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.630
And the most important thing
is actually to say when

93
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.610
you realize that you've made a mistake so
that we can correct it.

94
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.200
So I think the biggest problems that
companies will have is when someone's made

95
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.710
a mistake and they're either too afraid or
worried to bring it forward.

96
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.020
And so that's definitely
a huge part of our culture.

97
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.750
>> So you see, having the confidence to
ask for help when you get into trouble or

98
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.010
don't know how to do something.

99
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.390
Will be much more useful and admired than
hiding the fact that you are stuck and

100
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.190
don't know how to proceed.

101
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.800
By learning SQL you have already shown
your future employees that you embrace

102
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.030
the data driven nature
of the business world.

103
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.030
Don't be afraid to embrace the entire
culture that comes along with being so

104
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.240
focused on data.

105
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.950
It's a culture of intense curiosity,
perpetual learning, and

106
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.500
exciting new adventures
around every corner.

107
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.470
Asking question will be your fuel,
your inspiration, and

108
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.090
your greatest weapon in
this fast paced community.

109
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.740
I am so excited to hear about
the questions you ask to move

110
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.550
the field forward.

111
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.570
As my parting gift to you before you go
off to make your data discoveries, here is

112
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.870
the link that might help you remember all
of the things you learned in this course.
