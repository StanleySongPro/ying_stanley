00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.322
>> In this video, Jana Schaich
will show you how to use his tool,

2
00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:09.890
ERDPlus to make a relational schema.

3
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.106
If you need a reminder about how
the general structure of the ERDPlus

4
00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:15.872
website is organized,
please refer to the last video that

5
00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:18.990
has a demonstration about how to
use ERDPlus to make ER diagrams.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.730
And now, here's an ad.

7
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.610
>> This video demonstrates how to use
ERDPlus to create a relational scheme out.

8
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.870
Once you're logged into your ERDPlus
account, go to the Diagram section.

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.513
Before we demonstrate how to create a
sample relational scheme up, first, let's

10
00:00:37.513 --> 00:00:41.653
take a look at the previously created ER
Diagram that we will use as the basis for

11
00:00:41.653 --> 00:00:43.496
the sample relational scheme up.

12
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.122
Keep this ER Diagram in mind as we now
go and create a relational schema.

13
00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:00.244
Click on New, select Relational Schema,

14
00:01:00.244 --> 00:01:03.209
click on the name of
the New Relational Schema and

15
00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:07.210
now you are in a drawing surface for
creating relational skills.

16
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.220
We start by creating the first stable.

17
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.834
This stable is named location.

18
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.521
First column of this table is LID.

19
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:22.098
The next column is L main.

20
00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.069
We will declare a primary key
of this stable by clicking on

21
00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.606
the Primary Key button and
we will choose LID as the primary key.

22
00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:35.065
The next table is called Project.

23
00:01:39.153 --> 00:01:41.620
Let's start creating columns, PID.

24
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:45.242
Pete name.

25
00:01:47.427 --> 00:01:51.120
People project would
also have a foreign key.

26
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.560
LID, referencing the primary
key LID off the location table.

27
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.679
To create a foreign key, click on Connect,

28
00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.230
click on the table that
provides the foreign key.

29
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.140
Hold the left-click down and drag to
the table that gets the foreign key.

30
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.450
This creates a foreign key.

31
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.979
Now let's create a primary key of
the project table by clicking on

32
00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.746
the primary key button and choosing PID.

33
00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:26.080
In ERDPlus, you can change
the order of columns easily.

34
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.070
Let's move the LID column one spot up.

35
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.745
Now, lets move the LID
column one spot down.

36
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:40.550
The next table we will create
is the table employee.

37
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.010
The columns are EID and e-name.

38
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.050
Primary key is the EID column.

39
00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.519
The final table of this relational schema
is a bridge table works on resulting

40
00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.302
the many-to-many relationship between
employee and project entities.

41
00:03:05.302 --> 00:03:10.558
Click on the table, name it works on and

42
00:03:10.558 --> 00:03:17.280
now we have add two foreign
keys to this table.

43
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.010
One coming from table employee and
one coming from the table project.

44
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.390
Click on Connect and
creates two foreign keys.

45
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.721
In addition, this table has
another column, number of hours.

46
00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:45.907
This column indicates how many hours
each employee worked, on each project.

47
00:03:45.907 --> 00:03:48.397
We will not declare
the primary key of this table.

48
00:03:48.397 --> 00:03:52.170
The primary key is a composite
key composed of EID and PID.

49
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.290
Our sample relational
schema is now created.

50
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.550
It is also already saved in the diagram
section of your ERDPlus account.

51
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.460
In addition,
by clicking on the Diagram and clicking on

52
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.210
Export Diagram File, you can save
the same diagram on to your computer.

53
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.250
Also, you can save the image of
the diagram by clicking on Export Image.

54
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.195
Saving the image allows
you later to copy and

55
00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:29.530
paste it in to PowerPoint,
Word or any other application.

56
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.063
This concludes the small demonstration of
how to create sample relational schema and

57
00:04:37.063 --> 00:04:40.828
the resulting relational
database using ERDPlus.
