1
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:07.752
Sequel.

2
00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:09.432
>> S-Q-L.

3
00:00:09.432 --> 00:00:10.784
>> Sequel.

4
00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:11.951
>> S-Q-L.

5
00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:12.795
>> Sequel.

6
00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:13.824
>> Sequél.

7
00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:17.320
>> Squul.

8
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.740
>> Clearly, nobody seems to agree
how to pronounce the acronym for

9
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.280
the database language you
are going to learn in this course.

10
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.610
The most common pronunciations
are either SQL or Sequel,

11
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.910
but there is truly no agreement about
which pronunciation is more accepted.

12
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.070
A blogger named Patrick Gillespie
amusingly emailed a man named

13
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.260
Don Chamberlin to ask about the official
pronunciation of the language's name.

14
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.818
Don Chamberlin co authored SQL or sequel
with Raymond Boyce at IBM in the 1970s.

15
00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:46.290
So if anybody should know what
the language is called, it's Don.

16
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.660
Don responded with, Hi Pat.

17
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.300
Since the language was originally named
Sequel, many people continued to pronounce

18
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.040
the name that way after it
was shortened to S-Q-L.

19
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.540
Both pronunciations are widely used and
recognized.

20
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.060
As for which is more official, I guess
the authority would be the ISO standard,

21
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.680
which is spelled and
presumably pronounced SQL.

22
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.300
Thanks for your interest, Don Chamberlin.

23
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.840
So even the co author of the language
can't say with confidence how the name of

24
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.528
the language is pronounced.

25
00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:17.340
The best he can say is that
it's presumably pronounced,

26
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.200
not definitely pronounced or
even usually pronounced SQL.

27
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.960
To make things more confusion
some of the most popular

28
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.450
database systems in
the world such as Oracle

29
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.110
say explicitly in their documentation that
the language is pronounced See-Quill.

30
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.190
Others, such as MySQL say explicitly
that their name is My Ess-Cue-Ell.

31
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.060
So I wasn't exaggerating when I said
there is no agreement about how to

32
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.690
pronounce the name of the language.

33
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.310
That means you can use whichever
pronunciation you like better.

34
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.590
Personally I like using
both pronunciations,

35
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.860
sometimes even in the same sentence.

36
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.830
I will go back and forth between the two
pronunciations throughout the course.

37
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.830
So why should we care about SQL or Sequel?

38
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.170
Companies have to keep
track of a lot of data, and

39
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.490
the only practical way to do that is to
store the data is some type of database.

40
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.970
If you are becoming a data analyst for

41
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.570
the business world, somehow you are going
to have to figure out how to get data

42
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.790
out of these databases in order
to do any kind of analysis.

43
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.810
This course is designed to
help you learn how to do that.

44
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.021
In many technology driven companies,

45
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:19.664
the only way to retrieve data from a
database is to write your own SQL queries,

46
00:02:19.664 --> 00:02:22.711
which are structured lines of
computer code that extract data.

47
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:25.855
In other larger and more traditional
companies there are people in the company

48
00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:28.903
who could extract the data for you, but
you have to put in a formal request for

49
00:02:28.903 --> 00:02:30.394
them to write and execute and query.

50
00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:33.739
And it could take days or weeks for them
to fill your request especially if many

51
00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.325
other people are asking for queries too.

52
00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:40.005
For this reason, companies are very
eager to hire analysts who can not only

53
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:43.860
analyze data but who know how to
get the data in the first place.

54
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.990
As some evidence of this,

55
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.680
academic researchers of
the Teradata University Network

56
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.670
were in a study to determine the state
of business intelligence and analytics.

57
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.290
They asked over 400 recruiters
from technical companies to

58
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.380
answer the question.

59
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.780
When I recruit for business intelligence,
business analyst roles,

60
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.480
it is important that the students have
the following coursework or knowledge.

61
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.560
Then the recruiters had to rank
a bunch of possible responses.

62
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.830
The number 2 answer companies gave,
was SQL and Query skills.

63
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.260
The number 3 answer companies
gave was Basic Analytics.

64
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.610
Therefore, according to this survey, the
ability to pull data out of a database is

65
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.760
even more important than analytical skills
for getting a business analyst job.

66
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.020
We are dedicating an entire course
in the specialization to helping you

67
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.829
acquire this ability.

68
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.360
By the way, if you're curious about what
the number 1 response companies gave in

69
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.310
the survey was, it was very interestingly,
Communication Skills.

70
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.615
That's why we dedicated course three of
this specialization to Data Visualization

71
00:03:38.615 --> 00:03:39.460
and Communication.

72
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.500
I mentioned earlier that SQL is
the language used to retriever data from

73
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.010
specific types of databases
called relational databases.

74
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.050
Relational databases
are the gold standard for

75
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.780
data bases that store highly organized and
structured business data.

76
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.560
Almost every single company in the world
has at least one relational database.

77
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.500
There are also new classes of
databases specifically designed for

78
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.010
data that are collected in an extremely
fast rate, such as GPS or biosensory data,

79
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.350
or unstructured data that does not fit
well into highly prescribed formats,

80
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.410
such as tweets or texts.

81
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.550
However, although these databases
are certainly likely to gain

82
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.870
popularity in the future,

83
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.750
right now they only represent a very
small fraction of the database market.

84
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.270
As you can see from this graph produced
by the International Data Corporation,

85
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.320
a global market intelligence firm, annual
sales from the current database market

86
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.040
are over $40 billion, and are expected to
top $50 billion in the next few years.

87
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.290
The green in the bars on this chart
illustrates that almost all of these

88
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.680
billions of dollars are spent on
relational database technologies.

89
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.390
Therefore, although there are definitely
exciting things to learn and

90
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.650
know about other databases,
we chose to focus on how to manage

91
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.790
big corporate data using relational
databases in this specialization.

92
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.620
The second part of the title
of this course refers to MySQL

93
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.320
which is a particular brand or
platform of relational database.

94
00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.770
There are many relational database
platforms including Oracle, Microsoft,

95
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.930
SQL Server, DB2, SQLite,
Microsoft Access, and PostgreSQL.

96
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.250
We chose to focus on MySQL.

97
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.500
To help explain why,

98
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.470
I'd like to introduce you to Ryan Luecke,
senior software engineer at Box.

99
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.390
>> Hi, my name is Ryan Luecke and

100
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.610
I work at Box as a senior
software engineer on our caching

101
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.300
infrastructure team, which is closely
related to our database engineering team.

102
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.270
Box is an online file sharing and
collaboration service for businesses.

103
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.680
Box lets multiple people
across the country or

104
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.770
across the world work on
documents at the same time and

105
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.015
store them in a safe place
that is accessible to anyone.

106
00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:44.105
A good reason to highlight Box in this
course is that Box's entire interface

107
00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:46.675
is based on relational database concepts.

108
00:05:46.675 --> 00:05:49.645
Every time you store a new document
in a folder in your Box account,

109
00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:51.535
it's like a new row in a table.

110
00:05:51.535 --> 00:05:54.405
Every time you add a new collaborator
to a document it's like adding

111
00:05:54.405 --> 00:05:56.245
a new relationship between tables.

112
00:05:56.245 --> 00:06:00.570
So in Ryan's words,
>> Really, then what Box is, is a very

113
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:07.150
pretty interface to get to all of
the underlying database operations.

114
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.120
>> This means that people who work at Box
have a really deep understanding of what

115
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.860
relational databases do,
because their entire product

116
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.050
is based on making sure the relational
database works quickly and perfectly.

117
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.560
And importantly for this course,
Box uses MySQL as its primary database.

118
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.350
Here is Ryan's explanation for
their choice.

119
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.760
>> Choosing a relational
database is a difficult task.

120
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.435
There are a lot of
relational databases and

121
00:06:30.435 --> 00:06:32.880
non-relational databases to choose from.

122
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.700
And one reason we chose
MySQL was it's reliable,

123
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.090
it's mature, it's open source,
and well understood.

124
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.630
There's a lot of industry and
community around MySQL.

125
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:50.090
There are conferences around MySQL,
and a lot of tools for it.

126
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.590
And it also meets our relational needs, so
it's able to do what we need it to do to

127
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.100
store data for millions of users,
and billions of pieces of content.

128
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.040
>> But box is by no means the only
well known company to use MySQL.

129
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.190
Here are some other companies that
rely heavily on MySQL databases.

130
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.480
>> So Facebook uses MySQL,
YouTube within Google.

131
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.371
Yelp uses MySQL, Dropbox.

132
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:21.197
GitHub which stores a lot
of developer files and

133
00:07:21.197 --> 00:07:25.662
projects, LinkedIn, Etsy online store,

134
00:07:25.662 --> 00:07:30.610
Send grid, Twitter, Booking.com, Square,

135
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.730
Pintrest, Yahoo, and lots of others.

136
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.650
>> Those are a lot of big name companies.

137
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:43.530
Given that MySQL is open source, free for
anybody to use, well understood, and

138
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.990
used by so
many companies you might want to work for,

139
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.680
we thought it was an important database
with which to give you some experience.

140
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.020
Each database system does use its
own slightly different version of

141
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.560
SQL language, so
you will have to be prepared to look for

142
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.770
the differences if you start working
with another type of database.

143
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.270
Don't worry, languages are very similar.

144
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.780
Writing SQL queries is kind
of like driving a car.

145
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.750
Every time you use a different car, you
might have to spend some time looking for

146
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.660
where the buttons and
adjustment knobs are.

147
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.680
But if you know how to drive one car,
you know how to drive all of them,

148
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.440
as long as they have the same
transmission type, that is.

149
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.320
Same thing with different
relational database systems.

150
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.730
Once you know how to use SQL
to interact with one database,

151
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.000
you know how to use SQL to interact
with all relational databases.

152
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.040
You are going to get
a sense of how small or

153
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.890
large the differences in SQL languages are
in this course because we decided to give

154
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:33.350
you access to another type of relational
database in addition to a MySQL database.

155
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.330
The second relational database
it a Teradata database.

156
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.430
We chose Teradata because it is the leader
in what is called data warehousing.

157
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.710
A data warehouse is a copy of
historical and current company data

158
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.190
that is structured explicitly for
querying and analytical reporting.

159
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.760
Their warehouses are commonly used for

160
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.060
things like company dashboards that allow
executives to make decisions based on

161
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.580
real time data and graphs that show how
those data relate to trends from the past.

162
00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.060
Well known companies which store petabytes
of data in Teradata bases include Walmart,

163
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:06.080
Sam's Club, Verizon, AT&T,
Bank of America, and Apple.

164
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.450
Having experience with both a MySQL and a
Teradata database will give you confidence

165
00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.880
that you can navigate
different database systems and

166
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.320
will provide you with a strong competitive
edge in the data analytics marketplace.

167
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.170
Here's what we will cover
in the next few weeks.

168
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.510
By the end of this course, you will
be able to describe the structure of

169
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:27.920
relational databases, interpret and
create entity relationship diagrams and

170
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.510
relational schemas that describe
the contents of specific databases.

171
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.110
Write queries that retrieve and
sort data that meet specific criteria, and

172
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.820
retrieve such data from MySQL and

173
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.650
Teradata databases that contain
over one million rows of data.

174
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.550
Execute practices that limit the impact
of your queries on other coworkers.

175
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.050
Summarize rows of data using
aggregate function and

176
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.130
segment aggregations according
to specified variables.

177
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.790
Combine and manipulate data from
multiple tables, across a database.

178
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.790
Retrieve records and

179
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.060
compute calculations that are dependent
on dynamic data features.

180
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.510
And translate data analysis
questions into SQL queries.

181
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.540
Now long from now you will have
a highly coveted skill set

182
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.530
that will make you very attractive
to data analyst recruiters.

183
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.250
You will also have a powerful set
of tools to help you provide real

184
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.330
tangible value to your business.

185
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.980
I'm very excited to learn about
all the doors that will open for

186
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.460
you as you embrace this important feature
of the data driven business world.

187
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.650
It's going to be a fun ride.
