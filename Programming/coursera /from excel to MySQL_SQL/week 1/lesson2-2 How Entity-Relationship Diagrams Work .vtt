00:00:04.262 --> 00:00:08.160
In this video, we're going to go over
the basic building blocks of a relational

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.250
database and learn how to make
entity relationship diagrams.

3
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.620
Remember I said that databases are
collections of tables that each have their

4
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.420
own unified theme.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.590
Another thing that I mentioned that we
will really emphasize more strongly

6
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.190
over the next few videos is that
these tables are linked by one or

7
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.525
more columns with the same values.

8
00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:28.969
These columns allow you to
connect rows in different tables.

9
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.180
As an example, we can see here
that the Customer Contact column

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.510
of the Orders table and the ContactID
column of the Customer Contact table

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.140
are populated by the same types of values.

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.232
Whenever there is a value of cid1 in
a row of the Customer Contact column of

13
00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:45.290
the orders table.

14
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.626
We can find all the information about that
Customer Contact by looking up cid1 in

15
00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:53.440
the ContactID column of
the Customer Contact table.

16
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.220
Figuring out exactly what
information you want to collect and

17
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.150
exactly how you can organize information
to link tables, can be tricky.

18
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.990
So database architects often draw diagrams
called entity relationship diagrams or

19
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.050
Diagrams to communicate the structure of
the database they intend to implement to

20
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.420
the rest of their team before
they actually make the database.

21
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.190
This is what an Diagram might look like.

22
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.360
The person who made this
one color coated theirs so

23
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.810
that it kind of looks like a bunch
of flowers at least to my eye.

24
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.920
Normally, they look like
a collection of ovals,

25
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.680
rectangles and
diamonds collected by lines.

26
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.420
Clearly, Diagrams are not fine art.

27
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.180
What Diagrams are supposed to
represent are the conceptual

28
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.940
relationships in your data.

29
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.150
What is related to what?

30
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.390
And how?
You will see,

31
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.080
even if you never design
a database in your life,

32
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.140
being able to read these diagrams can be
very helpful for writing tricky queries.

33
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.870
In addition, looking at lots of Diagrams
to get a sense of how different data and

34
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.000
databases can be organized,
will help you build an intuition for

35
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.610
the types of data relationships you
will work with in your own databases.

36
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.280
Let's dive in and learn what
the pieces of these diagrams mean.

37
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.240
The boxes in the Diagram
are called Entities.

38
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.990
They represent categories of data
your database will keep track of.

39
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.270
Each box is one category.

40
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.470
Eventually, each entity will probably
become a table when the database is made.

41
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.280
The ovals in the Diagram
are called Attributes.

42
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.907
These represent aspects of each category
or entity that will be recorded.

43
00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:25.092
Attributes will likely become the columns
in the table that will be built around

44
00:02:25.092 --> 00:02:25.846
that entity.

45
00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:30.780
Each attribute in the Diagram has to
be connected to at least one entity.

46
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.800
Further, according to the rules of set
theory, each attribute must be unique for

47
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.200
that entity.

48
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.180
So you shouldn't,

49
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.390
in theory at least, have two college start
dates in your student entity, for example.

50
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.990
Let's step away from the Diagrams for
a moment to discuss more terminology.

51
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.760
Each time you collect data
relevant to an entity,

52
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.010
those data are collectively
called an entity instance.

53
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.850
You can think of entity instances
as the rows in a data table.

54
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.090
The most important attribute of the entity
is the attribute that has a unique

55
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.450
value for each entity instance.

56
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.560
Formally, they are called
Unique Attributes.

57
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.210
Informally, they are also sometimes
called unique keys or unique identifiers.

58
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.280
Unique attributes or keys or
identifiers, in table form,

59
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.450
would be a column that has a different
unique value for every single row.

60
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.070
They're like the ID columns we saw earlier
that allow us to link tables together.

61
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.829
Every entity must have at least one
attribute that serves as a unique key or

62
00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:28.760
identifier.

63
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.410
With that vocabulary under a belt we
can now return back to our diagrams.

64
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.980
You indicate unique
attributes in an entity by

65
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.530
underlining their title in the oval.

66
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.800
In our diagram, StudentID is
the unique attribute for STUDENT, and

67
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.220
CollegeName is the unique attribute for
COLLEGE.

68
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.380
This means that every STUDENT will
have their own unique StudentID, and

69
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.390
every COLLEGE will have
its own unique name.

70
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.480
If there are multiple attributes
underlined in an entity,

71
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.390
any one of them could potentially
be used as a unique key or

72
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.960
identifier to link the table with other
tables when the database is implemented.

73
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.390
Every entity or

74
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.550
category has to be related to at least
one other entity in the database.

75
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.600
You use a diamond and lines to represent
and describe these relationships.

76
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.840
The word in the diamond spells out
the nature of the relationship.

77
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.240
And the diagram shown here,
STUDENT attend COLLEGE.

78
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.700
Now here's where things
get really important for

79
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.540
an analyst who will be querying
a database tree for information.

80
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.940
Each relationship between entities in
the Diagram shows how many instances of

81
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.050
one entity are associated with how
many instances of another entity.

82
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.190
If you thing back to when you were asking
questions about the EGGER'S ROAST COFFEE

83
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.230
spreadsheet.

84
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.632
Many of our questions about whether data
entry was correct or an error could have

85
00:04:44.632 --> 00:04:48.012
been answered if we knew the nature of
the relationships between the columns.

86
00:04:48.012 --> 00:04:51.608
For example, does each company
have one contact person, or

87
00:04:51.608 --> 00:04:53.236
multiple contact people?

88
00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:55.872
Turns out that there
more than one by the way.

89
00:04:55.872 --> 00:04:58.720
Is each order supplied from exactly
one distribution center, or

90
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.620
can there be multiple
distribution centers?

91
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.960
How many addresses can be associated with
a given EGGER'S ROAST COFFEE employee?

92
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.250
These limitations on the relationships
between two entities, which,

93
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.730
once the entities have
been made into tables,

94
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.730
also ends up meaning the relationships
between the values in the columns that

95
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.370
link the two tables together,
are called cardinality constraints.

96
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.590
And they're indicated by the little
symbols next to the entity rectangles

97
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.790
in our Diagram.

98
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.560
There are a couple of
different formats of Diagrams.

99
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.690
But in the format we
are using in this course,

100
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.380
the symbol closest to the rectangle
represents the Maximum number of instances

101
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.450
of the entity that can be
associated with another entity.

102
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.469
And the symbol farthest away from the
rectangle, represents the Minimum number

103
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:42.087
of instances of that entity that can
be associated with another entity.

104
00:05:42.087 --> 00:05:46.207
To understand the relationships between
entities in the arrow diagrams that have

105
00:05:46.207 --> 00:05:47.530
this format.

106
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.860
All we start from one entity,
follow the connecting line and

107
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.000
then interpret the symbols
closes to the second entity.

108
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.470
So if we start with college
in our diagram here,

109
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.150
we can see that each COLLEGE
is attended by students.

110
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.920
These symbols here are the ones
closest to students.

111
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.950
So they are the ones we will use to
interpret relationship in this direction.

112
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.153
If the symbol next to an entity is
a straight line, that means one.

113
00:06:11.153 --> 00:06:14.310
If the symbol looks like a bird's foot,
that means more than one.

114
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.420
Remember that the symbol farthest
away from the second entity indicates

115
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.620
the Minimum while the symbol closest to
the second entity equals the Maximum.

116
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.720
So the way we would read this diagram
is that, each COLLEGE must be attended

117
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.480
by at least one STUDENT but
can be attended by many students.

118
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.500
The way we would read the relationship
in the opposite direction is that each

119
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.330
students attends a minimum of 1 but
no more than 1 COLLEGE.

120
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.780
Sometimes the Diagrams provide more
specific cardinality constraints than just

121
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.040
one and many.

122
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.300
When they do, those constraints
are indicated by specific numbers in

123
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.630
parenthesis.

124
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.970
There are two important things
to know about the notation for

125
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.450
Specific Cardinality Constraints.

126
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.926
First, the numbers in parentheses take
precedence over the bar symbol in

127
00:07:02.926 --> 00:07:04.168
the minimum constraint.

128
00:07:04.168 --> 00:07:07.938
Second, and pay attention to this one
because it is potentially confusing,

129
00:07:07.938 --> 00:07:10.606
the numbers in the parentheses
are always written with

130
00:07:10.606 --> 00:07:13.859
the minimum number on the left and
the maximum number on the right.

131
00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:14.679
In order to try and

132
00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:18.202
be consistent with written languages
that always write from left to right.

133
00:07:18.202 --> 00:07:21.884
Importantly, the numbers are always
written in this left to right direction

134
00:07:21.884 --> 00:07:25.677
even if the numbers in parenthesis refer
to a relationship that is depicted from

135
00:07:25.677 --> 00:07:27.820
the right to left direction.

136
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.310
I know, that's a little strange,
but let me show you what I mean.

137
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.364
If we read this Diagram in this
direction which is from right to left,

138
00:07:35.364 --> 00:07:38.842
despite the fact that there is
a bar symbol that usually equals 1.

139
00:07:38.842 --> 00:07:42.078
And despite the fact that the numbers
in parenthesis are written so

140
00:07:42.078 --> 00:07:45.796
that the minimum number is on the left and
the maximum number is on the right.

141
00:07:45.796 --> 00:07:50.358
We interpret the diagram to mean that each
college must be attended by a Minimum of

142
00:07:50.358 --> 00:07:53.930
1,000 students and
a Maximum of 10,000 students.

143
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.700
One symbol to know about is the M which
I have also sometimes seen as an N.

144
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.018
It means Infinite.

145
00:08:01.018 --> 00:08:05.819
If the 10,000 was replaced by an M or an
N, that would mean that the COLLEGE could

146
00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.500
be attended by an infinite
number of students.

147
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.390
Another symbol to know
about is the circle.

148
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.250
The circle means Optional.

149
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.930
So if we read this Diagram in a left to
right direction, we would learn that each

150
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.000
STUDENT could attend as many as two
colleges, but doesn't have to attend any.

151
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.560
By the way, as a small detail, for this
interpretation to make sense, there would

152
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.480
have to be some other attributes
in the database not pictured here.

153
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.763
That could be used to explain, why the
STUDENT was relevant to the database even

154
00:08:34.763 --> 00:08:36.484
if he or she wasn't attending a COLLEGE.

155
00:08:36.484 --> 00:08:39.434
For example, perhaps they transferred nor
dropped out.

156
00:08:39.434 --> 00:08:43.962
So now you understand how to read
the most fundamental parts of an Diagram.

157
00:08:43.962 --> 00:08:46.719
In the next video,
we'll talk through some Diagrams,

158
00:08:46.719 --> 00:08:50.548
that will give you a sense of some of the
more complicated organizations you might

159
00:08:50.548 --> 00:08:52.650
see in databases you
work with in real life.
