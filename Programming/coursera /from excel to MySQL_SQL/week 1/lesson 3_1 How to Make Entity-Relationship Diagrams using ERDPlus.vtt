00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:09.330
Now that you know how ER diagrams and
relational schemas work, is going to show

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.770
us how to use his tool ERDPlus to
make your own diagrams and schemas.

3
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.820
The tool can be found at erdplus.com.

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.300
When you go to the web site, you'll
see a place where you can sign up for

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.362
a free account so that you can save and
revise your work.

6
00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:25.060
Once you make an account you'll
see this home screen for

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.560
all the diagrams you've made are listed.

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.910
If you make a new diagram or

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.290
open up an old one the program brings you
to this work space for diagram service.

10
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.181
To orient you all the buttons
that allow you to add new parts

11
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.530
to the diagram are up here
at the top of the screen.

12
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.750
All of the menu items that let you name or

13
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.150
define parts of a diagram are over
here to the right side of the screen.

14
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.450
Once you have a diagram
that you are happy with,

15
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.390
remember this diagram button all
the way over here to the upper left.

16
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.830
It will let you export the diagram as
an image so that you can save it for

17
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.370
reference later.

18
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.880
I think you will find the tool
to be very intuitive.

19
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.390
I'll let Nenad take it from here.

20
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.640
>> Hello.

21
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.300
My name is Nenad Jukic.

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.180
I'm a Professor of Information Systems
at Quinlan School of Business,

23
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.780
at Loyola University Chicago.

24
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.460
I'm excited that you're
about to use ERD plus.

25
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.770
This is an excellent tool for

26
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.870
people who are trying to learn
about databases such as yourself.

27
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.580
I hope you enjoy the tool and
good luck with your course.

28
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.320
This video demonstrates how to use
ERDPlus to create a ER diagram.

29
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.270
Once you're logged into your account,
go to the diagram section.

30
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.290
Click on the new,
then choose ER diagram option.

31
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.680
Click on the name of the new ER
diagram to enter the drawing surface.

32
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.270
Let's create a small ER diagram.

33
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.100
We will click on the entity icon and

34
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.450
place the entity anywhere
in the drawing surface.

35
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.410
We will name this first entity location.

36
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.791
We will add two attributes to this entity,
location id and

37
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:06.030
location name.

38
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.030
We will declare location id to be unique.

39
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.360
Now let's add another entity.

40
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.000
We'll name this entity Project.

41
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.700
We'll add attributes.

42
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.980
Project ID and Project Name.

43
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.030
Project ID is unique.

44
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.410
We'll add one more entity.

45
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.790
We'll name this one Employee.

46
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.540
Employee has Employee ID which
is unique and employee name.

47
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.790
Now, we can create some relationships
between these entities.

48
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.090
To create the relationship,
we have to click on the connect icon

49
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.480
then click on one entity in this case
project and drag to another one.

50
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.350
In this case, location.

51
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.960
We just created a relationship
between project and location.

52
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.990
We will call this
relationship Takes Place.

53
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.210
Now we will declare cardinality
constraint for this relationship.

54
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.130
Each project takes place at exactly
one location, whereas each location

55
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.750
has at least one project taking
place at it but can have many.

56
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.900
Now let's create a relationship
between employee and project.

57
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.020
Again, we'll click on Connect, click
on EMPLOYEE and drag over to PROJECT.

58
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.558
We will name this relationship WORKSON.

59
00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:46.390
Each employee works on at least
one project but can work on many.

60
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.880
Each project has at least one employee
working on it but can have many.

61
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.560
Works on is a many to many relationship,

62
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.060
many to many relationships
can have attributes.

63
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.595
To demonstrate, we will create an
attribute for this relationship WORKSON.

64
00:04:05.437 --> 00:04:09.500
We will create an attribute,
and name it, number of hours.

65
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.350
Signifying that it keeps track
of number of hours that each

66
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.210
employee works on each project.

67
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.360
This conclude a small demo of how to
create an ER diagram using ERD plus.
