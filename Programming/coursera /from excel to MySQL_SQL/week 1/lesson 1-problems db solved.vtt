1
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.960
Why do we need databases in all this
complicated database query language?

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.500
Why can't businesses keep things simple
and just store things in spreadsheets?

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.630
It seems like that would make
things a lot easier on everyone.

4
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.690
Well, let's examine that premise
that keeping company data in

5
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.560
spreadsheets would make
things easier on everyone.

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.310
Imagine you are working with Daniel Egger
as he stars up Egger's Roast Coffee,

7
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.850
the business he described in Course 1 of
the specialization Business Metrics for

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.760
Data Driven Companies.

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.250
Your first week of business, Daniel
personally handled orders from some great

10
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.540
companies that he dutifully kept
track of in this spreadsheet.

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.190
You entered all the information that
it seemed important to track and

12
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.990
things look good.

13
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.480
Now, fast forward a couple of years.

14
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.910
Edger's Roast Coffee's done
extraordinarily well, and

15
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.330
Daniel has become coffee
king of North Carolina.

16
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.600
There are huge numbers of orders coming
in every day, and now many people

17
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.810
are entering those orders into the
spreadsheet you made the first week, and

18
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.510
many people are keeping track of and

19
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.239
modifying the orders as
customers call to ask questions.

20
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.630
Actually I just said that very calmly, but

21
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.200
the truth is what I just said puts
misleadingly positive outlook on what's

22
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.540
probably happening in the ordering
department of Egger's Roast Coffee.

23
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.450
What's really happening is that
multiple people are trying to

24
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.730
enter those orders into a spreadsheet,
but that doesn't always happen because

25
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.640
now Egger's Roast Coffee
has over 1 million orders.

26
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.120
So the one spreadsheet you made when the
company started has been broken into six

27
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.570
separate spreadsheets so

28
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.010
that Excel doesn't crash every
time you try to enter an order.

29
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.870
Breaking the spreadsheet into six has
helped prevent Excel from crashing.

30
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.410
But now every time a customer calls
to ask a question about an order or

31
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.330
an invoice, It takes a couple of
minutes before the employee can

32
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.520
find the correct spreadsheet
that has the order.

33
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.520
Especially because each
spreadsheet is still very large so

34
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.450
it takes Excel a while to open each one.

35
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.990
The more annoying part is that multiple
people are trying to use the spreadsheet

36
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.370
at the same time.

37
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.670
So when a customer calls with question,
you have to wait until somebody

38
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.310
else finishes with the spreadsheet
before you can open it yourself.

39
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.460
As a consequence,

40
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.990
you all start coming up with elaborate
ploys to keep the spreadsheet open on your

41
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.130
computers so that you are the one that
has it loaded when a customer calls.

42
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.140
Fortunately, everybody
at Egger's Roast Coffee

43
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.850
realizes that it's bad business
practice to have employees get

44
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.800
kicked off the ordering
spreadsheets when they need them.

45
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.770
So the company agrees to move their
spreadsheets to an online service

46
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.910
that let's multiple people edit
the spreadsheet at the same time.

47
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.710
Cool, but now new problems are arising.

48
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.500
First of all,
the spreadsheets are still pretty big.

49
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.290
So they still take a while to open and
search.

50
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.090
Second, sometimes multiple people end up
interacting with a spreadsheet at the same

51
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.710
time, and they end up writing
over each other's entries.

52
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.470
Third, there's starting to be a lot
of inconsistencies in the data

53
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.070
which are hard to catch if you don't
have multiple spreadsheets open at once.

54
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.720
And only a few people have
computers that are powerful enough

55
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.190
to open multiple spreadsheets
of that size at once anyway.

56
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.390
As some examples of these inconsistencies,

57
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.410
here are some excerpts from
the master spreadsheets.

58
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.250
Is the customer Archway's contact Trudy,
or Mark?

59
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.120
And if it's Trudy, which email address
is in the spreadsheet is her true email?

60
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.990
Are Trudy's email addresses different
because someone entered the second

61
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.140
one by mistake, or because Trudy
has actually changed her email?

62
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.990
One of the reasons you might worry that
Trudy's second email was a mistake,

63
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.770
is because lots of mistakes
have been occurring recently.

64
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.840
Every time a returning customer makes an
order, an Egger's Coffee employee has to

65
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.380
type in all that information about
the returning customer again,

66
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.230
even though it's already been entered
in the spreadsheet multiple times.

67
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.800
Since the employees are doing their
best to keep the customer happy,

68
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.320
they end up entering
the information really quickly, and

69
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.510
as a side effect,
are more likely to make a mistake.

70
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.880
Other issues that have gotten annoying
are that when a mistake is made in

71
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.050
one place in the spreadsheet it often
means that an employee has to change

72
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.220
multiple fields in the spreadsheet
to correct the mistake.

73
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.620
So when it turned out that Lina wasn't
actually the Egger's roast coffee employee

74
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.110
to make this sale, somebody had to update
this column that had Lina's name but that

75
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.840
person also had to update these columns
with Lina's contact information and

76
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.275
sale number.

77
00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:03.220
It would have saved a lot of
time if that were automatic.

78
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.952
There were formulas in these columns at
one point that made updating automatic,

79
00:04:07.952 --> 00:04:10.361
but now there are so
many different spreadsheets and

80
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:14.193
mistakes in the spreadsheets, that the
formulas often output the wrong thing, so

81
00:04:14.193 --> 00:04:15.200
nobody trusts them.

82
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.580
And the problems don't stop there.

83
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.690
Sometimes, it would be useful to
keep some information in a row, but

84
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.450
delete other information.

85
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.010
Here for example,
Lulu's decided to cancel their order.

86
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.440
So you delete the order information in
an effort to make sure the formulas that

87
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.150
tally up the sum of
your sales are correct.

88
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.300
But you would still like to keep Lulu's
contact information in the company's

89
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.439
records so that you can try to woo them
back to placing an order in the future.

90
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.500
The problem is that you have a row with
a lot of empty data, an employee looking

91
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.650
over the spreadsheet trying to
reconcile records for an audit, might

92
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.990
think the row is a big mistake and either
get worried or erase it all together.

93
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.890
Speaking of audits, the company ended up
switching invoice systems along the way,

94
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.480
and some orders are being made
on the old invoice system

95
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.970
while others are being
made with the new system.

96
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.340
The employee who was responsible for
reconciling the companies records needs to

97
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.600
separate the sales made on two systems,
but it's difficult to do so because yet

98
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.760
another separate analysis spreadsheet
is used for the analysis.

99
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.630
And it's hard to keep that analysis
spreadsheet up to date when there are new

100
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.718
orders being added all the time.

101
00:05:16.718 --> 00:05:20.140
Further, Egger's Roast Coffee would like
to start collecting more information about

102
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.760
its customers to improve
marketing efforts.

103
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.870
However, the number of columns that
need to be added to each spreadsheet to

104
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.940
accomplish these marketing analysis
would more than triple the size of

105
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.990
the spreadsheets.

106
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.330
That would make the spreadsheets
even slower than they are now.

107
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.080
So, as you can see, starting by entering
Egger's Roast Coffee records into

108
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.880
a spreadsheet is easy and
made a lot of sense.

109
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.010
But as the company grew,

110
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.520
spreadsheets became increasingly
inefficient and inaccurate.

111
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.450
At this point keeping
the company's data and

112
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.780
spreadsheets would really
hinder the company.

113
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.850
If Egger's Roast Coffee ever gets to the
point in the future where they're making

114
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.960
millions of sales per year,
the spreadsheet system will become

115
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.080
a huge bottleneck in the company's
ability to maintain customer service,

116
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.610
keep track of its finances,
and make business decisions.

117
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.270
For Egger's Roast Coffee to stay
competitive, they need a data storage

118
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.280
solution that makes their information
easily retrievable, easy to update,

119
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.770
and accessible and modifiable by
multiple people at the same time.

120
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.060
In addition, especially because so
many people will be accessing the data,

121
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.570
there needs to be a way to make sure the
data are consistent across all the stored

122
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.620
records and that data aren't being
deleted or lost inadvertently.

123
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.290
The storage method also needs
to be space efficient, so

124
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.709
the data aren't being repeated and
taking up extra space.

125
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.800
Of course,
the storage needs to be fast as well.

126
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.860
Data need to be entered,
search, and retrieved quickly.

127
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.330
Finally, another thing we
didn't talk about yet,

128
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.480
is that the company's data
also needs to be very secure.

129
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.400
When you're storing financial information,
adding a password to a spreadsheet is not

130
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.700
going to be enough to keep that
information safe and protected.

131
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.540
That long list of problems that
arise when a lot of people

132
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.890
are using a lot of data are the exact
problems databases are meant to solve.

133
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.205
Watch the next video to find out how
relational databases in particular,

134
00:07:01.205 --> 00:07:02.068
manage to do that.
