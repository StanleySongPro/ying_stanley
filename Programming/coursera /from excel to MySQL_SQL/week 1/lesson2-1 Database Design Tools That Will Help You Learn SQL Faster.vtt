00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:07.145
Last video we heard about how
relational databases use set theory and

2
00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:11.051
relational algebra to allow us to pull
pretty much whatever data we want out of

3
00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:13.020
a relational database.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.890
In this video, we are going to talk about
how you learn to tell a database what you

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.459
want out of it.

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.430
The way you ask a database to
give you data is to write and

7
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.710
execute what is called a query.

8
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.540
The language or

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.760
code you use to write the queries is
SQL or structured query language.

10
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.910
SQL is used by every relational database
management system, abbreviated DBMS,

11
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.110
even if there are some slight nuanced
differences across platforms.

12
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.790
As a data analyst, you are almost
guaranteed to interact with the relational

13
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.190
database at some point in your career,
if not everyday.

14
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.195
But even if you are interacting with
databases that do not use traditional

15
00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:51.830
relational structures, most database
management systems try really

16
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.540
hard to create query languages that
look as similar as possible to SQL.

17
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.940
Because SQL is so intuitive and so
ubiquitous in the database world.

18
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.070
Therefore, no matter what database
platform you end up working with,

19
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.960
it will advance your
career if you learn SQL.

20
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.430
And the more you understand
about SQL truly works,

21
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.120
the greater edge you will
have in the marketplace.

22
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.230
I have a slightly different view of
learning SQL than you will find in many of

23
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.900
the courses out there.

24
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.740
As a data analyst, you will be making lots
of queries, but you will not be setting up

25
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.855
or maintaining databases unless you
are working in an early stage startup.

26
00:01:22.855 --> 00:01:27.580
Nonetheless, my experience has taught
me that you will learn queries

27
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.460
much faster and
your queries will be much more efficient

28
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.970
if you know some of the basic tools
that are used to set up databases.

29
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.140
In addition, if you know how to read
the documents database engineers and

30
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.220
managers create, your life will be much
easier when you start writing queries and

31
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.060
you'll be less likely to make certain
kinds of mistakes that lead you to

32
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.980
misinterpret your data.

33
00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:49.630
So I really wanted to find ways to give
students in this course exposure to

34
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.490
the tools that are used
to design a database.

35
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.350
Fortunately, the person who wrote my
favorite tools was very generously willing

36
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.260
to share his resources with us.

37
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.330
Perhaps not surprisingly,
he also shares my view about learning SQL.

38
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.022
Here he is.

39
00:02:05.022 --> 00:02:09.810
>> Hello, my name is Nenad Jukic, and
I'm a Professor of Information Systems at

40
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.450
Quinlan School of Business at
Loyola University Chicago.

41
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.860
It is difficult to learn
SQL as a pure beginner if

42
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.220
one doesn't know some basic things
about relational database model itself.

43
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.940
The main concept in
relational database model

44
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.070
that connects tables of
a concept of a foreign key.

45
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.257
And if a person doesn't really
understand why is it there,

46
00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:41.770
how it works,
it makes learning SQL very unnatural.

47
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.640
So the best way to learn SQL in
my opinion is to first learn

48
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.940
few basic things about database design and
modeling before we start learning SQL.

49
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.040
>> Entity-Relationship diagrams or
ER diagrams

50
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.830
are one of the database design tools that
will be useful for you to understand.

51
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.930
ER diagrams are pictures
that represent how

52
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.210
the data in a database are supposed to
be connected or related to one another.

53
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.900
Relational schemas are another database
tool you will benefit from learning how to

54
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.380
read and understand.

55
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.890
Relational schemas are basically
maps of the database.

56
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.630
Sometimes relational schemas are missing
important information, that is contained

57
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.129
in an ER diagram, so it is useful to
practice and understand both tools.

58
00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:27.130
Nenad has made a very well
design online program that

59
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.950
will allow us to practice making both
ER diagrams and relational schemas.

60
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.670
So here's what we're going to do for
the rest of this week.

61
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.640
In the next few videos, we are going
to go over some practical concepts of

62
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.880
how relational databases are organized,
and go over how to make ER diagrams and

63
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.530
relational schemas.

64
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.170
Then Nenad will show you himself how to
use the great online tool he created.

65
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.146
After practicing with
a couple assignments,

66
00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:52.035
you will answer some questions about
the relational schema of a real

67
00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:55.449
life department store data set we will be
using in the later weeks of the course.

68
00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.258
And you will make your own ER diagram and
relational schema for

69
00:03:58.258 --> 00:04:00.429
the real life startup data
set we will be using.

70
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.400
This will prepare you how to start
learning how to answer business questions

71
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.480
about those data sets next week
when we start writing SQL queries.

72
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.480
Are you excited?

73
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.267
I hope so.
